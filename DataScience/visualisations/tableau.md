> Seven approaches to data storytelling are change over time, drill down, zoom out, contrast, intersections, factors, and outliers

> Keep the viz simple with the purpose, audience, and actionable insights in mind, while utilizing aesthetic properties to strengthen our story’s theme.

#### Designing a Story

What are the objectives or core questions?

Who is the audience?

What insights can be drawn from the data?

Types of story:

\-Changes over time

\-Drill down from broad to details

\-Zoom out from small to broad

\-Contrast different subjects

\-Intersections (divide a subject into factors)

\-Outliers - highlight and profile outliars

Question to ask yourself:

\-Does the visualisation serve it's purpose?

\-Are my narrative and chart choices appropriate?

\-Am I following best practice?

\-Have I enhanced my story with aesthetics?

#### Stacked proportion charts
