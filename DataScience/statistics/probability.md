# ðŸŽ² Probability

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Set Theory</mark>

Set theory. {item1, item2}\
Items are unique and in no order\
You define a set using a letter.\
A = {item1, item2, item3}

Subset = a set contained entirely in another set\
A,B,C is a subset of A,B,C,D,E,F,G

Sample point = single outcome of an experiment\
Sample space = all possible sample points

A specific outcome is an event or subset of the sample space\
P(Event) = occurrences / total trials

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Law of large numbers</mark>

Repeating an experiment a large number of times to get close to the true probability.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Types of Probability</mark>

Union - A or B

Intersection - A and B

Complement - Ac - Not A

A set and it's complement cover the entire sample space

Mutually exclusive

Events can't happen at the same time

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Dependent and independent probability</mark>

Independence - Previous observations don't affect future ones\
Dependence - Previous observation does affect the future

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Conditional Probability</mark>

Measuring probability given another one just occurred\
P ( This Event | Something First )

Addition Rule - one event or another\
Multiplication rule - one event and another\
Not mutually exclusive - probabilities overlap

P ( A or B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) - P ( A and B )\
Add the probabilities and subtract the intersection

Mutually exclusive - no overlap\
P ( A or B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B )

Independent events\
P ( A and B ) = P ( A ) \* P ( B )

Dependent events\
(Intersection of both things happening)\
P ( A and B ) = P( A ) \* P ( B | A )

Can be visualised with a tree diagram

Each branch is a specific set of events\
All branch possibilities sum to 1\
Multiply across branches to calculate probability

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Bayes Theorem</mark>

P( B | A ) = ( P ( A / B ) \* P ( B ) ) / ( P ( A ) )

![](https://images4.imagebam.com/9e/6d/08/MERZS7N\_o.png)

This is the probability of event 1 happening after event 2.

Example

Possibility of having strep throat if you test positive

Event 1 - probability someone has it\
Event 2 - Probability of testing positive
