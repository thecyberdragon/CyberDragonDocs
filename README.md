# Overview

***

Columns are things to measure\
Rows are instances, observations, or entities\
Data should be tidy



<mark style="color:yellow;">**Types of data**</mark>

***

Numerical - Measurements are numerical with units (1.0, 2.5, 8, -56)Continuous - measurementsDiscrete - counts

Categorical - Categories describe characteristics with words

Nominal - Describes somethingOrdinal - A ranking

Binary values - Two possible values\
_id in a table is a number but it's a label so it's categorical_

Dichotomous values are true or false

Rankings are ordinal values - ordered

A convenience sample is a data subset for preliminary analysis but not good enough for a comprehensive analysis and introduces bias



<mark style="color:yellow;">**Five types of data analysis**</mark>

***

**Descriptive**

Usually the first step. Summary statistics.\
Central tendency and spread. Mean, mode, median, St dev, quartiles etc.\
Visualisation

**Exploratory**\
Look for relationships between variables.Spotting correlation**Cluster anaysis (machine learning)**PCA - principle component analysisK - clusteringRand statisticsLike confidence coefficient, a rand close to 1.0 is strong**Inference**A/B test.Split a sample in half randomly and test A or B.Calculate within 5% chance the result is down to random chance-Sample size must be 10% of the extrapolated population-The sample must be randomly selected and represent the population-One variable should be tested at a time**Causal**-Change one variable at a time-Carefully control all other variables-Can be repeated with the same results multiple timesCausal correlations require-Advanced techniques-Meeting strict conditions-Appropriate statistical tests**Predictive**Uses predictive analysis and supervised machine learning.-Regression models-Support vector machines-Deep learning convolutional neural networks

**Bias in data**

***

\-Selection bias (not randomising your data / selecting the data)-Automation bias (relying entirely on automation)-Algorithmic bias (When an algorithm produces repeatable errors and unfair outcomes)-Evaluation bias (Algorithm testing a non-representative dataset)Evaluation biases:-Confirmation bias (seek answers we already think)-Overgeneralisation bias (Extending generalisations between datasets)-Reporting bias (only reporting positive results)

**Data Collection**

***

**PII Personal Identifying information**Consent - Obtain itOwnership - individuals own their dataIntention - How is the data to be used and storedPrivacy - Keep info private, especially PII**Types**Static data - collected onece and doesn't change (like a survey)Non-static - data changes and updates**General**Validity is the relationship between the data and its purposeDoes this variable measure what I think it does?

**General Steps**

***

\-Formulate questions that can be answered with data-Clean and transform the dataset-Apply correct statistical techniques to answer the question-Support the analysis with visualisations-Summarise the main takeaways

**Portfolio rules**

***

Tableu & Power BI -> don't take screenshots. Publish the graph (keep the internativity)Code files -> Save as the code file, not a documentWritten reports -> Use images from tableu etc, it's OK
