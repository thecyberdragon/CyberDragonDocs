### <mark style="color:yellow;">Principles of agile management</mark>

Segment a project into several incremental steps with regular feedback intervals.\
Project requirements are segmented into small chunks and prioritised

Adjusts at regular intervals to meet needs\
Integrate planning with execution

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Advantages</mark>

* Faster feedback cycles and identify issues early
* Higher potential results
* Better visibility
* Flexible prioritisation focused on value

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Disadvantages</mark>

* Critical path and dependencies might not be clear
* Learning curve
* Technical dependencies

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Embrace Requirements</mark>

* The product owner’s focus is to optimise value of output.
* The team can only do the work it’s capable of doing - don’t push
* Roadmaps gives context
* Work in progress limits keep everyone delivering high quality work

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Scrum Framework</mark>

Uses sprints to accomplish work in a short week to month time period.\
Scrum board = kanaba board

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">4 Ceremonies of scrum</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Planning</mark> - meeting to identify objectives and set sprints. One per week\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Daily stand up</mark> - 15 minutes to discuss progress, what’s next and identify blockers\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Review</mark> - Show results and complete tasks\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Retrospective</mark> - meeting to analyse the sprint - what to improve and process

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Kanaba Framework</mark>

Focus on maximum output and agility using kanaba boards where all work is visible.\
WIP limits are used to stop people doing too much

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Components of Kanaba</mark>

List of work as tasks\
Set up the columns to distinguish tasks\
Set WIP limits\
Release continuously

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Responsibility of the project manager</mark>

Estimate WIP limits and estimate the project\
Report on progress\
Manage backlogs\
Communicate to stakeholders

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Lean framework</mark>

This means the elimination of anything that doesn’t produce value.

Key practices are continuous integration, small batch sizes, feedback loops and working in cross-functional teams. This is used to optimise collaboration in highly regulated industries where speed of delivery is essential.
