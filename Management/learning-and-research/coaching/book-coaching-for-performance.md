Principles define the centre of gravity, or the ideal state, or what is truly desired. Rules define the boundary of what is acceptable and in many cases limit the growth of what is possible. Running an organisation by rules generally leads to a company operating at the boundary of what is tolerable, rather than fulfilling its potential.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching is bigger than coaching</mark>

Performance = potential - interference.

Odysseus, when setting out for Troy, entrusted his house and the education of his son Telemachus to his friend, Mentor. ‚ÄúTell him all you know,‚Äù Odysseus said, and thus unwittingly set some limits to mentoring.

Psychological optimism is essential if we are to fully embrace coaching as the leadership style of the future.

Maslow called the final stage self-actualizing rather than self-actualized, because he saw it as a never-ending journey. The primary need associated with self-actualizers is the need for meaning and purpose in their lives. They want their work, their activities, and their existence to have some value, to be a contribution to others. They are interdependent.

Self-belief is not created by prestige and privilege, which are more symbolic than substantial. It is built when someone is seen to be worthy of making choices. Promotion without genuine empowerment and the opportunity to express potential is counterproductive.

Service to others manifests in a wide spectrum of forms, is very fulfilling, and is the universal way to meeting this need.

Development is a journey, not a destination.

Coaching is the mechanism for transformation.

In essence coaching is about partnership, collaboration, and believing in potential.

Creating High-Performance Cultures

Leaders must adopt a coaching style. These companies have already identified that coaching is the leadership style of a transformed culture, and that as the style changes from directing to coaching, the culture of the organisation will begin to change. Hierarchy gives way to partnership and collaboration, blame gives way to honest evaluation and learning, external motivators are replaced by self-motivation, protective barriers fall as teams build, change is no longer feared by welcomed.

Blame is about history, fear, and the past. We need to refocus on aspiration, hope, and the future.

Blame evokes defensiveness and reduces awareness. Appropriate adjustments cannot be put in place without accurate feedback. Fundamental culture change will not happen if blame culture comes along too.

Offering someone choice and control whenever possible in the workplace acknowledges and validates their capacity and their self-esteem.

‚ÄúCulture eats strategy for breakfast‚Äù.

‚ÄúAcross the spectrum, the cultural DNA of an organisation is critical to success, from operational efficiency to better customer service, to greater talent attraction and retention, to higher levels of business performance and breakthroughs in innovation.‚Äù

The greatest influencers of an organisation‚Äôs culture are its leaders.

If blame and criticism are prevalent communication styles and this doesn‚Äôt change, relationship failure can be predicted with over 90 percent accuracy.

How this manifests in organisations is that it breaks down relationships and blocks learning.

‚ÄúIt is an interesting feature of human psychology that, once we have someone to blame, the quest for explanation seems to come to an end‚Äù.

Each incremental shift in mindset towards interdependence leads to improved performance.

A coaching leadership style is the enabler for high-performance culture, because it shifts the organisational mindset to interdependence.

If you can‚Äôt measure it, you can‚Äôt manage it.

Coaching is emotional intelligence in practice

Coaching is not merely a technique to be wheeled out and rigidly applied in certain prescribed circumstances. It is a way of leading and managing, a way of treating people, a way of thinking, a way of being.

Transformational coaching is the practice of emotional intelligence.

Emotional intelligence is twice as important, 66 percent to 24 percent, as academic or technical knowledge for success at work - for everyone, not just leaders, in terms of both relationships and productivity.

Emotional intelligence is self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Awareness levels</mark>

Awareness of self - understanding why you do what you do. Learn to recognise your human tendencies, internal interferences, and biases in order to consciously choose responses rather than reacting.

Awareness of others - seeing the person behind the performance. Learn to spot people‚Äôs strengths, interferences, and motivations in order to manage relationships and inspire and collaborate successfully with individuals and teams.

Awareness of organisation - creating a positive impact on culture. Learn to align individual, team, and organisational goals and develop a coaching style which leads to high performance, learning, and enjoyment.

Meaning and purpose are the drivers for Maslow‚Äôs level of self-actualisation and the mindset of interdependence.

Talent retention is a vital issue and expectations about the way people are treated are rising fast. Prescription, instruction, autocracy, and hierarchy are losing traction and acceptability. Good people want more choice, more responsibility, and more fun in their lives, and that includes the workplace.

What business would not like better performance? This is widely accepted intellectually in organisations, in both public and private sectors, but they still struggle to embed and embody the behaviours they advocate. In many cases both leaders and followers collude to resist change, even though that benefits neither.

Coaching builds leaders, and there is a lack of leadership today, in every sector, in every institution, and in every country.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">The leader as coach</mark>

For coaching to work at its best, the relationship between the coach and the coachee must be one of partnership in the endeavour, of trust, of safety, and of minimal pressure.

The attraction of telling or dictating is that, besides being quick and easy, it provides the dictator with the feeling of being in control. This is, however, a fallacy. A dictator upsets and demotivates their employees, but those employees dare not show it or offer feedback, which would not have been heard anyway.

There is another problem with the dictating end of the traditional management spectrum: recall. Quite simply, we do not remember very well something we are told.

Attractive as democratic discussions may be, it can be time-consuming and result in indecision.

If the direct report feels obliged to take responsibility, rather than choosing to do so, their personal ownership remains low and their performance will not reflect the benefit of the self-motivation that leaders hope to generate.

A leader‚Äôs task is simple: to get the job done and to develop employees.

So how can leaders find the time to coach their employees? It is so much quicker to dictate. The paradoxical answer is that if leaders do coaching their employees, the developing employees shoulder much greater responsibility, freeing leaders from fire-fighting and not only coach more, but to attend to those overarching issues that only they are required to address.

If leaders manage by the principles of coaching, they get the job done to a higher standard and develop their people simultaneously. It sounds too good to be true to have 250 days a year of getting the job done and 250 days a year of employee development per person, but that is precisely what a coaching leader does get.

It is the continuous awareness and employment of the underlying principles of coaching during the many brief daily interactions that occur between leaders and their people at work that result in on-the-job development.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">A coaching style: Partnership and collaboration</mark>

The main characteristics of a coaching style are partnership and collaboration as opposed to command and control. Coaching is a conversation between equals.

Carrots help people perform better, for a while, but if we view and treat people like donkeys, they will perform like donkeys.

Collaboration is not compatible with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the expert‚Äù or ‚Äúthis is the way we do things round here‚Äù.

As a coach or leader, the effectiveness of what you do depends in large measure on your beliefs about human potential.

Leaders must think of employees in terms of their potential, not their past performance.

Developing your emotional intelligence and the ability to trust is about how you see yourself and others in terms of potential, and how you deal with internal and external obstacles that hinder the full expression of this potential.

Businesspeople are anything but logical when the need for change in management behaviour is raised. They far prefer to hope for, look for, pay for, or even wait for a technical structural fix, rather than adopting human or psychological performance improvement, however straightforward it may be.

Pretending you are optimistic is insufficient, because you convey your genuine beliefs in many subtle ways. Building others‚Äô self-belief demands that you change the way you think about them, and in doing so, release the desire to control them or maintain their belief in your superior abilities and thus make them dependent.

For people to build their self-belief, in addition to accumulating successes they need to know that their success is due to their own efforts. They must also know that people believe in them, which means being trusted, allowed, encouraged, and supported to make their own choices and decisions. It means being treated as an equal, even if their job has a lesser label. It means not being patronised, instructed, ignored, blamed, threatened, or denigrated by word or deed.

What you think of a person will come through in your attitude and cause an impact, even if you don‚Äôt speak.

I invite you to choose to adopt the mindset that someone is capable, resourceful, and full of potential, the essence of a coaching mindset.

Another key element in maintaining partnering and collaboration is the use of permission. It builds trust and confidence, respects individual sensitivities, focuses attention, and prevents misunderstandings arising.

The antidote to criticism is curiosity.

By getting curious about what has happened, you enable yourself to enter a whole new perspective, thaty of the person you are working with. This creates learning and discovery for both and, ultimately, alignment.

A coaching ethos is positive and inspirational: it shines a bright light on what has worked well so far, what learning can be had from the past, and the pathway to the best that is possible in the future. Judgement, criticism, and correction put people on the defensive. And these tend to go hand in hand with blame. Fear of judgement or blasme is one of the key inhibitors to collaboration and high performance.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Awareness and responsibility: activating learning</mark>

A coach is not a problem solver, a counsellor, a teacher, an adviser, an instructor, or even an expert; a coach is a sounding board, a facilitator, an awareness raiser, a supporter.

I am able to control only that of which I am aware. That of which I am unaware controls me. Awareness empowers me.

No two human minds or bodies are the same. How can I tell you how to use yours to its best? Only you can discover how, with awareness.

[www.coachingperformance.com](http://www.coachingperformance.com/)

Awareness is knowing what is happening around you.\
Self-awareness is knowing what you are experiencing.

By becoming aware of something, you can change it. And you don‚Äôt even need to expend effort on it, as your natural learning system - that part of you that learned to walk, to ride a bike, to speak - will naturally respond and adapt to new information.

Higher than normal focussed attention leads to higher than normal performance.

When you truly accept, choose, or take responsibility for your thoughts and your actions, your commitment to them rises and so does your performance. When you are ordered to be responsible, told to be, expected to be, or even given responsibility if you do not fully accept it, your performance does not rise.

If I give you advice, especially unsolicited advice, and you take the action but it fails, what will you do? Blame me, of course, which is a clear indication of what you see the responsibility lying. I have traded my advice for your responsibility, and that is seldom a good deal.

Self-belief, self-motivation, choice, clarity, commitment, awareness, responsibility, and action are the products of coaching.

Telling someone to be responsible for something doesn‚Äôt make them feel responsible for it.

Your potential is realised by optimising your own individuality and uniqueness, never by moulding them to another‚Äôs opinion of what constitutes best practice.

Problems can only be resolved at the level beneath that at which they manifest themselves.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">The practice of coaching</mark>

Powerful questions promote proactive, focused thought, attention, and observation.

A key attribute of a coaching leadership style is the ability to ask powerful questions that focus attention and evoke clarity; questions that increase coachees‚Äô self-belief and self-motivation; questions that help coachees learn, grow and achieve success.

‚ÄúWhy‚Äù is discouraged since it often implies criticism and evokes defensiveness, and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù if unqualified, both cause analytical thinking, which can be counterproductive.

Questions should follow the interest and the train of thought of the coachee, not the coach.

If coachees are not allowed to explore avenues in which they have an interest, the fascination is likely to persist and cause distractions and diversions in the work itself. Once they have explored their interests, they will be fart more present and focussed on whatever will emerge as the best path. Paradoxically, it may also be valuable for the coach to focus on any aspect that the coachee appears to be avoiding.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Active listening</mark>

Usually when people appear to be listening they are just waiting their turn to speak, and once they do they follow their own agenda. They might talk about something totally unrelated or else want to share their experience, thoughts, and opinions, or give advice.

A monotone may signal low interest or repetition of an old line of thought. A more animated voice will hint at the awakening of new ideas and greater motivation.

If words say one thing and the body seems to be saying something else, the body is more likely to indicate the true feelings.

In most coaching sessions someone needs to take notes.

Good coaches will be applying self-awareness to monitor carefully their own reactions, of emotion or judgement, to any of the coachee‚Äôs responses that might interfere with the coach's necessary objectivity and detachment. Your own psychological history and prejudices - and no one is free of either - will influence your communication.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">The GROW model</mark>

Choice and self-motivation are critical to success.

Coaching will be used to progress a task or process that has been discussed before or is already under way. In such cases coaching may begin and end with any stage. One of the things which makes GROW so effective is that the framework is flexible.

Teams invariably set goals based on what has been done before rather than on what can be done in the future.

Goals formed by ascertaining the ideal long-term solution of vision, and then determining realistic steps toward the ideal, are generally far more inspiring, creative, and motivating.

Although they think they have threatened their employees into taking responsibility, this is not so, because the employees had no choice.

Goals - Clarifies the desired end result from the session

Reality - Provides understanding of the internal obstacles and blocks currently preventing or limiting progression

Options - What can you do?

Will - Outline possible future obstacles

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">G: Goal setting</mark>

Performance goal - identify the performance level that you believe will provide you with a very good chance of achieving the end goal. It is largely within your control and it generally provides a means of measuring progress.

Importantly, it is far easier to commit yourself to, and take responsibility for, a performance goal, which is within your control, than an end goal, which is not.

From inspiration to action:\
Progress goals - SMART steps - serves all goals below. What actions will you take?\
Performance goals - Tangible milestones - Serves below. What will you deliver?\
End goal - A clear target - What are you aiming to achieve? Manifestation of the dream.

Dream goal - Purpose and meaning - WHat‚Äôs the bigger picture? Vision - the big why

**PURE**\
Positively stated, understood, relevant, ethical

**CLEAR**\
Challenging, legal, environmentally sound, appropriate, recorded

When you set goals for yourself you can tend to aim too low, limiting yourself through fear. Encourage coachees to aim high so that they will stretch to achieve the best they can.

You tend to get what you focus on. If you fear failure, you are focussed on failure and that is what you get.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">R: What is reality?</mark>

Objectivity is subject to major distortions caused by opinions, judgements, expectations, prejudices, concerns, hopes, and fears of the perceiver.

Most people think they are objective, but absolute objectivity does not exist. The best you have is a degree of objectivity, but the closer you manage to get to it, the better.

The coach should use, and as far as possible encourage the coachee to use, descriptive terminology rather than evaluative terminology.

The more specific and descriptive your words and phrases become, the less criticism they tend to carry, and the more productive the coaching will be.

When the coachee has to stop to think before responding, maybe raising their eyes to do so, their awareness is being raised.

You have a measure of choice and control over what you are aware of, but what you are unaware of controls you.

Let silence do the heavy lifting.

Seek to remove or reduce inner obstacles to outer performance.

The demand for an answer is essential to compel the coachee to think, to examine, to look, to feel, to be engaged.

The questions need to demand high-resolution focus to obtain the detail of high-quality input.

The reality answers sought should be descriptive not judgmental, to ensure honesty and accuracy.

Questions should most often be initiated by the interrogatives ‚Äúwhat‚Äù, ‚Äúwhen‚Äù, ‚Äúwhere‚Äù, ‚Äúwho‚Äù and ‚Äúhow much‚Äù.

One reality question that seldom fails to contribute value is ‚Äúwhat actions have you taken on this so far?‚Äù followed by ‚Äúwhat were the effects of that action?‚Äù

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">O: What options do you have?</mark>

You can connect the coachee to their inner strengths by getting them to think of the qualities they admire in the**i**r hero and ask ‚Äúhow would X do that?‚Äù.

Another powerful way of uncovering options is to ask the person to create a metaphor for the topic or a situation they are wanting to resolve. Develop that metaphor and stick with it.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">W: What will you do?</mark>

Arguably, the most important role of a coach is to hold accountability, which is different from responsibility. Holding accountability means asking coachees to define specifically what they will do and when they will do it, and then trusting them to do just that.

How will this action serve your goal? Now that you have an action and a timeframe, it is important before you proceed any further to check that this is leading in the direction of both the goal of the session and the long-term goal.

What obstacles might you meet along the way?\
How will I know? Who needs to know?\
What support do you need?\
Merely sharing your intended action with another person often has the effect of ensuring that you do it.\
How and when are you going to get that support?\
It is no good wanting some support but not taking the steps necessary to get it.\
What other considerations do you have?

If you aren‚Äôt going to do something, cross it off your list. And if you want to be a success for ever more, don‚Äôt put anything on your list that you don‚Äôt intend to do!

It is important that both the coach and the coachee have a clear and accurate written record of the action steps and timeframe agreed.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Feedback and followup</mark>

It is crucial that feedback pathways are created if people are to learn, develop, and improve performance.

It is follow-up that increases learning and awareness, identifies possible blocks, and offers further support or challenge to meet goals. Blame or criticism has no place here and will undo all your good work. This is not to say that you cannot be candid.

Defensiveness must be avoided, because when it is present, the truth/reality becomes smothered in inaccurate excuses and justification, which both coachee and coach may believe and which are no basis for performance improvement.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">GROW feedback framework</mark>

In order to make feedback a learning op\[portunity, the key questions to ask are: what happened? What did you learn? How will you use this in the future?

Set intention - goal questions and context for feedback\
Recognise - Focus on what they did well and build strength\
Improve - Non-judgement is the key to safe learning. Give them space to reflect\
Learn - Check in on learning and set actions linked to development goals

Golden rule: coachee shares first, coach adds their perspective second

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Learning for all</mark>

Leadership mindset and behaviour are the biggest factors influencing performance, and they are 100 percent within the leader‚Äôs control.

Coaching for meaning and purpose

The point is not to become a leader. The point is to become yourself, and to use yourself completely - all your gifts and skills and energies - to make your vision manifest. You must withhold nothing.

Meaning is the significance we ascribe to an event or an action in hindsight, while purpose is our intent to embark on a course of action.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">From victim to creator</mark>

The biggest step to finding meaning and purpose is to realise that, ultimately, your current reality is your opportunity. It means stepping from being a victim of fate into being a creator of destiny.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Uncovering meaning</mark>

As a coach or as a leader adopting a coaching style, it makes sense that you should have already explored your own meaning and purpose and started to create your own destiny before leading your coachee into this advanced space. Another key tenant of coaching is not to ask a question of your coachee that you wouldn‚Äôt be willing to answer - or haven‚Äôt already answered - yourself.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Part IV: Specific applications of coaching**</mark>

Time periods for formal coaching

Formal coaching, commonly called 1:1 coaching or executive coaching, works best if it takes place over a period of six months.

There is a shorter alternative known as ‚Äúlaser coaching‚Äù, which takes the form of three 60-minute virtual coaching sessions and focuses on a specific challenge.

Number of hours. Format and length

The first step to any coaching engagement is for the coach to find out from the purchaser of the coaching what they are looking for.

Once the number of coaching hours has been agreed, the second step is to agree with the coachee the most suitable format and also the length of the sessions.

Every coaching engagement ends with a 1:1 evaluation of 60 minutes.

Fact-to-face coaching: e.g - 6 sessions of 120 minutes each, once a month for 6 months.

Telephone or virtual coaching. E.g - 12 sessions of 60 minutes each, every week for 6 months.

Mixed e.g - face-to-face for 60 minutes, 12 telephone coaching sessions 45 minutes each every other week, ending with a 60 minute face-to-face.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Chemistry meeting</mark>

The chemistry meeting is where you meet the coachee for the first time and is usually free of charge. It is an opportunity for both you and your coachee to check that you feel you are a good match to work together. It is customary to let each other know after the chemistry meeting if, on reflection, you feel you are a good fit or not. If not, don‚Äôt worry - sometimes the chemistry is just not there.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Confidentiality</mark>

Confidentiality is key to any coaching relationship, and the boundaries need to be defined at the outset.

Coach -> Coachee (Goals & objectives, confidentiality, coaching, results)\
Coachee -> Sponsor (Goals & objectives, results)

As a coach, you need to be clear about who has engaged you, their relationship to the coachee, and who you are accountable to regarding the coaching.

The sponsor, and possibly your coachees leader, may want to see both the goals and objectives of the coaching and the results. It is important that you co-design with your coachee how these people are involved in the coaching and that the coachee communicates this to them.

Communication with the coachee‚Äôs leader, the sponsor, or others in the organisation should always go through the coachee, so that at all times you are empowering the relationship of your coachee with the organisation.

Help coachees to have conversations with their leader or sponsor that will help them own their goals and objectives.

Where coachees are not fully committed to their goals and objectives, explore what is blocking them and help them find the resources within themselves to have authentic conversations with their leader.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Foundation session</mark>

A successful foundation session will set up a successful coaching engagement. As the name implies, the foundation session is dedicated to creating the basis of the coaching relationship with your coachee.

\-Format and agreements

\-‚ÄúTrain‚Äù the coachee - what is coaching (not mentoring or consulting or counselling)

\-Goals

\-Potted history - ask them to prepare in advance a summary of pivotal moments in their life

\-Power sources or values - values discovery, strengths discovery, metaphors that inspire the coachee, mindset and limiting beliefs

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Between sessions</mark>

It is important to keep a record of desired outcomes, actions, and timelines committed to and check back in at subsequent sessions to follow up on those actions.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Subsequent sessions</mark>

For the most part, the structure of the remaining coaching sessions will be something like this:\
\-Checking in and following up from last session\
\-Setting the session goal\
\-Coaching\
\-Setting accountability

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">360 feedback</mark>

A 360 degree feedback session can be a very useful before-and-after benchmark for coaching.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Coaching for team performance**</mark>

The coach needs to approach the team with full attention, curiosity, trust in the team‚Äôs resourcefulness, and openness to exploring different ways of achieving the task. What is more, in order to fully mobilise the potential of the team as a whole, the coach needs to understand the following:\
\-A team is its own entity, with intelligence we can tap in to\
\-Coaching can mobilise the team‚Äôs intelligence and potential by revealing, rather than overstepping or correcting, the dynamics present in the team\
\-The aim of coaching is to create collective awareness, and generate co-responsibility and alignment within the team

The team‚Äôs ability to perform does not depend only on the individual talents and skills of team members, but on the way those members work together, and on the degree to which they share objectives, values, purpose, and responsibility.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Stages of team development</mark>

In the same way that individuals cannot jump from childhood into adulthood, teams cannot become mature overnight.

A four-stage model for team development that is easy to understand is - inclusion, assertion, cooperation, co-creation. The first three stages follow William Schutz‚Äôs Firo-B theory of interpersonal behaviour and are readily recognised in most sports and workplace teams.

Inclusion (Forming) - Dependant (Belonging)\
The first stage is called inclusion, since it is here that people determine if they are, and if they feel they are, a team member.

Assertion (Storming) - Independent (Esteem from others)

Once the majority of team members feel included, another dynamic emerges, that of individual assertion. Schutz describes this stage as the need for control. It is a time of expressing power and of extending boundaries.

There will be challenges to leadership. Team members have to find out that they can disagree with the leader before they will be willing to agree.

A good group leader will offer, and encourage team members to take, responsibilities and thereby satisfy their assertion needs. It is important that the leader allows the challenges.

Cooperation (Norming) - Independent (Self-esteem)

Schutz‚Äôs third and ideal team stage was the affection stage, but some business people baulk at affection, so it‚Äôs called cooperation.

The most productive teams will be highly cooperative, but will retain a degree of dynamic tension. A coach preserves this sensitively.

Co-creation (Performing) - Interdependent (Self-actualising)

There is a fourth stage to the development of teams that goes beyond cooperation. It is the stage of co-creation, of transformation, and of personal and organisational evolution.

A coach who creates a safe space for team members to express their fears, discomfort, and needs will foster the team‚Äôs resilience, self-care, strength, and co-responsibility.

It is said that leaders only have two functions: first to get the job done, and second to develop their people.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Facilitating coaching conversations</mark>

If the focus is on team learning, then conversation will follow the GROW feedback framework but focus again on the team as an entity:\
\-What did we do well as a team?\
\-What team strengths showed up while we carried this out?\
\-What was difficult for us as a team?\
\-What did we learn?\
\-What will we do differently next time?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching by example</mark>

The team leader needs to be clear about their own willingness to invest time and energy into developing their team, with a view to fostering long-term quality relationships and performance.

The leader has that delicate yet powerful role of both initiating and facilitating, of leading but not imposing, of accepting what is while seeing clearly what can be and what is possible for the team.

Practical ways to fostering a coaching culture

What works for one team might not work for another, and the dynamics of the team require continuous attention, exploration, and care to get the best out of it.

Agree a set of ground rules or operating principles acceptable to all team members and to which all have contributed. These ground rules should be subject to regular checking as to whether they are being adhered to and whether they need to be changed or updated.

Educate leaders and team on the key communication skills and dynamics needed for a team to thrive.

Set aside time on a regular basis, usually in conjunction with a scheduled task meeting, for team development work. During this time agreements are reviewed, appreciations and gripes are expressed, and personal sharing may be included so that openness and trust are built.

Develop a common interest outside work.

Learn a new skill together.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching for lean performance</mark>

If people aren‚Äôt engaged and involved, it is more than likely that the leader is using a directive style.

On setting out to develop a lean culture, the starting point is to identify the overall challenge the team wants to strive for.

Kaizen, or ‚Äúgood enough never is‚Äù, is a well-known principle within lean cultures. The belief that no process is ever perfect opens up the possibilities of continuous innovation and evolutions to move towards the challenge through incremental improvement and occasional breakthrough.

Plan-Do-Check-Act\
\-Plan - the GROW sequence involves others in mapping out the plan for the next improvement\
\-Do - Implementation\
\-Check - Holding a non-judgemental attitude, generate high-quality feedback and assess\
\-Act - Back to GROW to work out what will change in the standard approach

The learning zone and the human element

Coaching processes on their own will have limited impact if coachees don‚Äôt feel able to step into the learning zone, or if they fear the consequences of making a mistake.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching for Safety Performance</mark>

Key approaches to coaching:

\-Non-judgement - the behaviours observed may fall below standards required, but this can be explored in partnership to create a learning culture.

\-Look for learning - there is always learning to bring out

\-Curiosity - Get curious about the challenges the person is experiencing, and what is needed to overcome these

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Part V: Realising the potential of coaching</mark>

The recording of actions and progress needs to be done in a shared document. If things are not written down, they cannot be captured and referred back to.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">How to effect culture change</mark>

If leaders truly listen to their people, act on what they learn, and enable their team to take responsibility for themselves and others, people will be happier, they will perform better, and employee turnover will plummet.

Coaching is therefore both the destination - the future high-performance culture - and a key ingredient in how to get there. A values-based future cannot be prescribed by some outside authority. Performance will always be at its best when employees, share-holders, directors, and even customers share the same values, but before that can happen, people need to be encouraged to identify what their own values are.

People cannot be forced to change, they need the opportunity to choose how to change.

Without a collective vision with which people are engaged, change cannot succeed, but without vision at the top it will not even start.

You must be prepared to make changes across the entire living system of the organisation. Widescale behavioural change will not be sustained without congruent processes, organisational and reward structures, and so on.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">The qualities of leadership</mark>

Leaders for the future need to have values and vision and to be authentic and agile, aligned and on purpose.

Leaders of the future should be obligated to embark on their own journey of personal development to earn the title of leader.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Values-driven leaders</mark>

So we need leaders who are values driven - that means collective values, not selfish values - and who are specific about their values so they can put them to best use for the most suitable issues.

_Richard Barett corporate transformation tools._

Not only do leaders need to be values driven, they also need to be able to translate those values into principles that will act as a guide for people working in the organisation.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Vision</mark>

The second essential quality that leaders must have is broad and deep vision.

So what is vision as a leadership quality? It can be broken down into two parts.The first is the ability to envision and dream; that is, to create a clear and bold image of how the leader wants things to be in the long term without impediment of conventional limits.

The second part of vision is the ability to communicate this image in such a way as to inspire others - to be visionary.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Authenticity</mark>

The next essential leadership quality is authenticity: when a person is who they really are, and is not afraid to be so in front of others. To achieve authenticity is an endless journey.

Roberto Assagioli‚Äôs definition of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù was a place inside of pure consciousness (awareness) and pure will (responsibility).

_Jim Collin‚Äôs book good to great_

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Agility</mark>

Another vital leadership quality is agility. The ability to be flexible, to change, to innovate, and to give up believed programs and goals is essential.

Agility is the product of two areas of personal growth to work. They are ridding yourself of the straitjacket of parental, social, and cultural conditioning and old beliefs and assumptions, and of eliminating fear, particularly the fear of the unknown that prevents you from being open to change.

As we get older, usually starting about age 30, we fall into countless small habit patterns. The same holiday location, the same wine, the same shopping day, the same clothes, the same walks or routes to work, the same order in the same restaurant, the same phrases, the same reactions.

Habits are the safe repetition of fear-avoiding behaviour. Breaking habits gives access to new avenues, makes life more interesting, opens the door to new discoveries, introduces new friends, makes you a far more interesting person, and may even give you tears of joy.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Alignment</mark>

Even more important is the inner or psychological alignment within leaders themselves, without which the more common, outer form of workplace alignment is hard to achieve. So what is inner alignment? It is, of course, alignment and collaboration between our subpersonalities.

When different parts of yourself, or your subpersonalities, hold differing values, decision making becomes an internal battle of values for dominance. Since what you value changes, or rather expands, as you develop psychologically, this inner conflict is a natural consequence of your maturation process.

Once the debate is over, everyone needs to be committed to the agreed decision. So it is with individuals, or should I say within individuals. Anyone who aspires to be a leader needs to develop inner alignment. If that does not happen, others will experience them as somewhat schizophrenic and they will not know where they stand - they will not know who they are dealing with.

Sometimes the cause and extent of a leader‚Äôs lack of alignment will not be consciously identifiable by the leader or by others; to other people they will just seem inconsistent, unreliable, untrustworthy, or inauthentic.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Leaders for the future</mark>

Leaders for the future need to have values and vision and to be authentic and agile and internally aligned. Add awareness and responsibility to the mix, self-belief, and a good measure of emotional intelligence, and it‚Äôs a powerful recipe.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">The ladder to mastery</mark>

The widespread use of instructional methods of teaching sport, at work, and at school is an indication of how poor general understanding remains about how people really learn. Part of the problem is that instructors, teachers, and leaders are concerned more about short-term gain, passing the exam, or getting the job done now than they are about learning or about the quality of performance.

Unconscious incompetence = Not knowing that you don‚Äôt know.\
Conscious incompetence = You know that you don‚Äôt know

Conscious competence = You know that you know

Unconscious competence = mastery and high performance

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Not trying</mark>

Identifying the quality you would like to bring in, say smoothness in gear changes, and, rather than trying to change gear smoothly, simply continue to observe how smooth your gear changes are. In order to quantify this to give yourself a more precise feedback measurement, you might create a 1-10 smoothness scale.

Unconscious competence slips in, monitoring of the scale falls away, and you maintain smooth gear changes even when driving conditions become extreme or you are driving an unfamiliar vehicle.

There is a world of difference between continuously trying to do something right and continuously monitoring what you are doing non-judgmentally. It is the latter, the input-feedback loop, that results in quality learning and performance improvement.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Learning and enjoyment</mark>

Performance, learning, and enjoyment are inextricably intertwined. All three are enhanced by high awareness levels, a fundamental objective of coaching.

When one of the three is neglected, sooner or later the other two will suffer. Performance cannot be sustained where there is no learning or where there is no enjoyment.

Enjoyment can come from experiencing a fuller expression of your potential. Each time you experience yourself stretching to somewhere you have never been before - in extension, in courage, in activity, in fluidity, in dexterity, in effectiveness - you reach new heights in your senses.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Advanced Coaching</mark>

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">The performance curve</mark>

Much of the psychological dysfunction in the world stems from frustration about the lack of meaning and purpose in our lives.

Psychosynthesis offers a number of maps and models, the strands of which weave a very useful cradle for in-depth coaching.

This kind of advanced coaching will invite the coachee to reframe life as a developmental journey, to see the creative potential within each problem, to view obstacles as stepping stones, and to imagine that we all have a purpose in life, with challenges and obstacles to overcome in order to fulfil that purpose.

Two dimensions of growth. Spiritual/qualitative & psychological/quantitative. Spiritual & success.

A businessperson may be focussed on personal achievement and success in the material world and may have become a well-integrated person, a good parent, and a respected member of society, without ever having asked themselves a meaningful question about life.

The opposite type of person leads a contemplative and ascetic life, but seems ill equipped to cope with the realities and essentials of the everyday world. Their home, their financials, and even their personality may be in a bit of a mess. These people live in a monastic life of study or art, and readily give gentle assistance to others.

The further we progress along either path to the exclusion of the other, the more we depart from the ideal or balanced path between the two, and the tension thereby created increases.

If social pressures, business imperatives, or blind determination to achieve override the tension that is attempting to pull us back on track, we are liable eventually to run into a wake-up wall. This wall is known as the crisis of meaning. When too much quantitative progress reveals a void of meaning.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Knowledge</mark>

The horizontal axis can also be equated to knowledge. The crisis of meaning occurs when our accumulation of knowledge far exceeds the tempering effect of our values.

Wisdom lies beyond knowledge and is deeper. It provides foresight, it is often paradoxical.

The 45 degree line in the graphs could thus be said to represent wisdom, lying between the extremes of what we might describe as indiscriminately exploited knowledge on one side and ungrounded spiritual fanaticism on the other.

Vertical excess can also lead people to a crisis, known as the crisis of duality, the split between their idealistic vision and the harsh realities of mundane life. They are brought down to earth with a bump, and may find themselves compromising their values to get a proper job.

There is a point of light that lies beyond the 45 degree arrowhead. It represents our higher self or soul, which could be seen as the source of our purpose and of wisdom.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Subpersonalities</mark>

There are times when I look over the various parts of my character with perplexity. I recognise that I am made up of several persons and that the person that at the moment has the upper hand will inevitably give place to another.

This model of advanced coaching works with what are called subpersonalities, different aspects of ourselves that may have different characteristics and objectives.

Have you ever woken up on a bright, sunny morning and thought ‚Äúwow, why don‚Äôt I get up and go for a walk on the beach?‚Äù and within an instant you hear another inner voice countering ‚Äúno, relax, stay in bed; it‚Äôs so warm and comfortable here‚Äù? Who is walking to whom? These are two subpersonalities and you have many more, including the one that listened to both sides of the dialogue.

We all adopt certain characteristics, or even personalities, in different circumstances depending on how we see ourselves or want to be seen.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching for an inner conflict</mark>

When a coachee has an inner conflict of some sort, you can ask ‚ÄúWhat part of you wants to do that?‚Äù and then ‚Äúwhat other characteristics does that part have? What does the other part want?‚Äù The purpose of these coaching questions is to help coachees to recognise and understand more about their drives and their inner conflicts as a prelude to resolving them.

You should be able to ask them to list some names for their subpersonalities.\
Which one of these do you find most disruptive? Under what circumstances does this one show up?\
Give me an example of a recent time. What did it want at the time?\
Did it get it? And if so, how do you think the other person felt?\
What would be another way of getting what you want in those circumstances?

It is possible to invite the coachee to conduct an imaginary conversation between the two parts and even have them negotiate.

Who are you?

Under various circumstances people will see and describe themselves as a businessperson, an Arsenal supporter, an accountant, a racing driver, a deminist, an American, a parent, a schoolteacher, an academic; you name it. None of those things is really who they are, but they are the part of themselves that they are identified with at that moment or under those circumstances.

Some people get severely stuck in one subpersonality. Thereby denying their own access to the other parts of themselves that may be more interesting, creative, humorous, appropriate, and so on.

A person can be likened to a team in which the different members have different qualities and different wishes and expectations. It is important to get the team to be open with each other, talk about their needs and differences, and start to collaborate and even support each other in order to meet their individual aspirations.

Another useful analogy is that the subpersonalities are members of a symphony orchestra: each plays a different instrument, but they can be grouped together.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-mastery</mark>

‚ÄúCan I become the conductor of my own orchestra?‚Äù The answer is yes, by disidentifying or stepping back from your subpersonalities and becoming the observer of the process.

In psychosynthesis terms the conductor is known as the ‚ÄúI‚Äù and it is described as a centre of pure consciousness and pure will.

How to reach alignment:\
Step one: Recognise that you have subpersonalities at all, identifying your most active ones and when they take you over.

Step two: Willingness to acknowledge to another person or people that conflicting subpersonalities exist, and to discover when they show up and take you over, what they want, how they limit you, and how they may serve you.

Step three: Get them to cooperate with one another, and this is where inner alignment starts.

Step four: The final stage is true synthesis or collaboration to the same end for the good of the whole. While this kind of developmental process can be undertaken at home through self-reflection, meditation, and visualisation, the processes themselves need prior experience or training.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Structured daydreaming or visualisation</mark>

Many advanced coaching methods seek to reach beneath the rational, logical, and limited mind into the subconscious, which is a whole system. Guided imagery can be used in structured daydreaming or visualisation to have coachees imagine themselves on a journey up a mountain, an archetypal symbol for growth; suggest to them that they meet certain things on the way, from gifts to obstacles, from an animal to a wise old teacher; and ask them to image what happens when this occurs.

This is something you can do with your coachees. It‚Äôs recommended to say it unprepared and spontaneously when you are confident enough, as it will sound more authentic.

When coachees have finished this visualisation and after a breather, coach them on the experience, focussing mainly on what the obstacles symbolised to them and what qualities they deployed to overcome it. What was the animal and what were their feelings about it? What was the conversation with the animal, and what did that symbolise?

The whole journey up and down taking, say, 15 minutes. The debriefing will be as long as a piece of string.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching</mark>

Supporting people to grow themselves and their performance, clarify their purpose and vision, achieve their goals, and reach their potential. Awareness and responsibility are increased through inquiry, purpose exploration, and self-realisation. Coaching focuses on the present and future, is a complete partnership between coach and coachee, and sees the coachee as whole (not broken or needing fixing), resourceful, and able to find their own answers.

Coaching is unlocking people's potential to maximise their own performance. It is helping them to learn rather than teaching them.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching mindset</mark>

The coach believes that the coachee is capable, resourceful, and full of potential. Believing in the dormant capability of a person will build their self-belief and self-motivation and enable them to flourish. And with that mindset, you can coach them to make their own powerful choices and find enjoyment in their performance and their success.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Dancing in the moment</mark>

The coach is fully present and follows the direction and flow of the coachee, noting changes in energy and creating awareness within both coach and coachee from each moment.

Declaration

Disruption

Emotional intelligence

Ethical guidelines, professional standards (ICF)

Evaluation

Goal setting

Gremlin

The personification of a belief that blocks us from moving forward. The coaching perspective is that the belief developed to keep us safe and that by becoming aware of it we can choose how it impacts our life. Rick Carson's book Taming your gremlin is excellent for clearing gremlins.

Hold focus

Hold space

Intuition

Listen with heart

The coach listens to non-verbal messages such as voice tone, phrasing, facial expression, and body language. When we are listening attentively at the level of feeling and meaning (the intent), our body language and facial expressions show this and encourage the speaker to open up to us.

Meet the coachee where they are

Mentoring

Npl, neuro linguistic programming

Non-attachment

Partnering

Permission

By asking if the coachee is happy to be coached in sensitive, intimate, or new areas, or before offering a hard truth or speaking to a gut feeling, the coach creates a safe environment, helps to build trust, and makes sure coaching remains a partnership.

Perspectives

The coach communicates other points of view which expand the way the coachee sees something, allowing them to examine their viewpoint and inspiring commitment to shift to a more resourceful place with possibilities.

Powerful questions

Purpose

Request

Responsibility

Review actions

Structured daydreaming

Systems coaching

Trust

Coaching relies on a deep and trusting connection between the coach and coachee, built on intimacy, mutual respect, and genuine concern for the coachee's welfare and future.

Values

Venting

Visioning

A process by which the coach helps the coachee to imagine what they want as if it has already happened or it has already been accomplished.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Whole systems approach</mark>

Recognises the interconnectedness of people, processes, organisations, and the communities they touch. Actively engages the ability to work with and develop the inherent systemic potential.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching questions toolkit</mark>

The golden rule is to be clear and brief. Sometimes the most powerful questions lead to a long silence, so don't feel the need to jump in with another question if there is a long pause.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-coaching</mark>

What would you like to work on? What would you like to have after answering this set of questions?\
What is your first goal related to this issue? When are you going to achieve it?\
What are the benefits for you? Who else will benefit?\
What actions have you taken so far? What is moving you close to your goal? What is moving you away from it?

What options do you have? What else could you do? What are the pros and cons of the options?

What will you act on? When are you going to start each one? Who can support you?

How committed 1-10 are you on each step? What will you commit to doing?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Conscious working agreements</mark>

What would success look like for us working together? What would the worst-case look like?\
What‚Äôs the best way for us to work together to achieve success? What do we need to be mindful of?

What attitudes do we need to bring? What permissions do you or I want? What assumptions are there?

What will we do when things get hard? What is working and not working?\
How can we be more productive? How can we both take responsibility for making this work?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Asking permission</mark>
