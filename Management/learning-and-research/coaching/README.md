Coaching is unlocking people’s potential to maximise their own performance. It is helping them to learn rather than teaching them. It is a form of conversation with unspoken ground rules of certain qualities that must be present: respect, openness, compassion and rigour, our commitment to speaking the truth.

A socratic-based future focused dialogue between a facilitator and a participant, where the facilitator uses open questions, summarises and reflections which are aimed at stimulating the self-awareness and personal responsibility of the participant.

Coaching is the art of facilitating another person’s learning, development and performance. Through coaching, people are able to find their own skills and change their own behaviours and attitudes.

Coaching is usually focussed on a specific goal or developmental area - the agenda is achieving goals.

The coach should keep the conversation on track so it doesn’t diverge into chit-chat.

A coach is a facilitator of learning and uses their skills to help someone improve their performance, and get them from where they are to where they need to be by unlocking their potential. It helps them learn rather than being taught.

Coaching is a conversation, or a series of conversations. The coach intends to produce a conversation that will benefit the coachee. Coaching isn’t restricted to work environments, and can happen in many ways and circumstances.

A coach isn’t a teacher or an instructor or a problem-solver. A coach is a facilitator, a questioner, a counsellor. To understand someone’s behaviour - problems can only be resolved at the level beneath that at which they manifest themselves. Coaching is from the assumption that the coachee is responsible for their circumstances and actions. The coach must observe objectively without judgement.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Timeline</mark> <a href="#dvlxk14w25kk" id="dvlxk14w25kk"></a>

Coaching goals can span 6-12 months typically

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Levels of goals</mark> <a href="#ogriltwwnmhc" id="ogriltwwnmhc"></a>

Flow of goal types:\
Personal goals > Performance goals > End goals.

<mark style="color:yellow;">End Goals</mark> - aspirational and challenging. They act as a compass and give direction.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Performance Goals</mark> - performance-oriented. They are specific and involve measurable outcomes.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Personal goals</mark> - behavioural goals which lead to performance results. They’re inputs that lead to output.

The purpose is to have an inspiring goal that is broken down into smaller achievable steps expressed in clear measurable terms.

## <mark style="color:red;">Principles of Coaching</mark> <a href="#xezp986xs8bf" id="xezp986xs8bf"></a>

***

\-Maintain a commitment to support the individual\
\-Build the relationship on truth, openness and trust\
\-The coachee is responsible for the result they are generating\
\-The coachee is capable of better results than they’re getting\
\-Focus on what the coachee thinks and experiences\
\-Coachees can generate perfect solutions\
\-The conversation is based on equality

The coachee should understand key information related to the coaching. The coach must demonstrate commitment to the coachees success. The approach has to be tailored to the coachee and must be treated as an individual. The coach must be able to be relied upon by keeping promises and leading by example.

Being told something doesn’t create mental maps. When we gain insight from thinking about something deeply we do. That’s how you facilitate learning. Telling someone is more likely to initiate a defensive thread response as the person’s thoughts and brain connections are in conflict with what they’re being told and creates a sense of pain in the brain. This moves people away from the information and increases the likelihood of resistance.

Telling rather than coaching wastes time and makes it harder for the person to accept new ideas. The coach’s job is to create insight not give advice. Coaching is about providing the right balance of support and challenge.

Empathy is different from sympathy. To empathise is to become one with the other person’s emotions. It’s understanding their emotions from their perspective.

Coaching is non-judgemental. Be curious and have an open and inquisitive mind. Do what’s best for the coachee by reflecting, providing feedback and asking good questions. Point out things you notice for example in their behaviour or posture. Often people don’t see stuff about themselves and no one tells them.

Feedback should be constructive, specific and observed.

Questions should start broad and narrow in focus and in more detail. This also keeps the coachees attention. Leading with questions undermines the coachee - they should be free to explore their own direction even if it’s wrong, and trust they will eventually find it. If the coach has a suggestion they should ask permission to give it first and only after the coachee gets stuck. Coaching is facilitative to unlock potential.

The question is the answer. Coaching builds accountability.

Coaching is interactive and collaborative. Motivate people to reach their highest level.

One of the fundamental roles of a coach is to help the person identify barriers in their way.

It’s your job to find out how they see the world, not impose onto them how you see it.

Allow them time to think of answers and allow silence. Don’t interrupt them unless they veer off course.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Encouragement and support</mark> <a href="#id-4ptd93hn1h6g" id="id-4ptd93hn1h6g"></a>

\-Match your own words with actions - lead by example\
\-Make time for people\
\-Actively give encouragement\
\-Make encouraging noises and statements\
\-Encourage them to see what is possible

Coaching is focussed primarily on the person and their circumstances. The other person learned and benefited from the conversation. Carrots on sticks aren’t coaching and don’t work. Coaching is built on relationships, safety, and trust.

The coach presses on when the coachee quits. When the coachee no longer cares about achieving their goals, the coach stays committed. When things don’t go well, your coach supports you. When you succeed, the coach acknowledges you and gives praise. They analyse what went well so you can do it again.

Feedback is important. It should be open, honest, and constructive. It should increase our learning and help us.

Self-esteem is the life force of the personality. If that is suppressed then so is the person. Building awareness and responsibility is the essence of good coaching. Coaching isn’t giving tools and sending them on their way.

Coaches win when someone else does. Pleasure comes from being a part of someone else's process and helping them see different ways to create the result they want. Solutions the coachee comes up with can be more pragmatic and reasonable to be put into action, and creates greater ownership. The coach must suppress the urge to be right, and encourage the coachee to become more powerful.

Building a good support structure is the key to successful coaching. The beginning of coaching is about understanding the coachee and evolves into consolidating the learning into further learning.

Too much scene setting can be counterproductive as part of effective coaching should include surprise and might over-promise results. The coaching room should be in the middle - cosey but not too cosey. You should be relaxed but alert. Sharing the structure before-hand is a good habit to get into.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">What works well in coaching?</mark> <a href="#ahfau74qs8ad" id="ahfau74qs8ad"></a>

Connecting personally, reflecting, having a good coach coachee fit, challenging feedback, good listening, good action ideas and pointers, and clear objectives.

Structured open questions, encouraging independent learning and thinking, general support and guidance, advice, playing to strengths, and conversation. Be warm and personal and the person should be relaxed. Sit at right angles and gently mirror their body language.

The best way to coach is to be coached. You know what works and what doesn’t. The results for the coach might be uncomfortable for the coachee and vise versa.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">When coaching doesn’t work</mark> <a href="#jy4tsqiqvacb" id="jy4tsqiqvacb"></a>

If the person hasn’t asked to be coached or the coaching has been sourced externally, the person needs to be talked to first and made sure they are happy being coached.

Some people don’t actually want to solve their problems, as solving them might encourage bigger problems. Tackling issues might also confront the person’s ability to do so when without trying they don’t need to. Honesty about this insight might be a way to get the ball rolling as the honesty might be appreciated.

Hints someone doesn’t want change - Lack of enthusiasm for new ideas, discusses problems not solutions, between sessions they do nothing. This applies to people who don’t want goals and want to move at their own pace in their own way.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Tips for a coach</mark> <a href="#id-8o2t17d0phek" id="id-8o2t17d0phek"></a>

Coaching is all about goals - No goal, no coaching. Sometimes the goal is to find a clear path or find out what they like.

Be content free - the coach doesn’t need to provide the details, that’s the responsibility of the person being coached

Why? - Avoid asking why. It implies judgement.

Highlight interest- if you notice something interesting in the person's speech or behaviour, point it out. Call it out

Dig deeper - The first issue is never it. Dig deeper and help them figure out what the real issue is

Investment - Coaching is a journey, not a destination. You can never stop investing in learning to coach.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">General coaching info</mark> <a href="#cv4djmnb61fy" id="cv4djmnb61fy"></a>

Coaching is a practice-based skill and takes hours of work. Less than 50 hours is novice level.

Understanding the industry as well as leadership helps frame the conversation.

Coachings should also have supervision.

Coaching should be based on evidence.

Selecting the coach has benefits to the fit instead of being assigned one.

## <mark style="color:red;">How our brains work</mark> <a href="#o3m7j88xzbrm" id="o3m7j88xzbrm"></a>

***

Our brains work by making connections and associations. It likes to link what’s happening to now to what is already experienced. This is a mental map to understand the world.

During the gradual learning process our brains have to create new maps which takes a lot of energy. Once the map is created we can focus easier on other things. “Neurons that fire together wire together”. When we learn new things the nerve cells change to fit the required processes.

The more you focus on something, the more you analyse something, the deeper the connection you create. “Myelination”. The more a neural pathway is used the stronger it becomes. This is why changing habits is hard but easy to do something new. The brain likes to use the neural pathways it already developed.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Telling = no</mark> <a href="#vahknvs3u6o4" id="vahknvs3u6o4"></a>

Telling someone what to do won’t buy them into your decision. They won’t learn and be less committed, take less responsibility and be less creative. You’ll have to keep telling them over and over. Coaching ignites creativity and innovation. Managers learning to coach in the long-term saves time.

<mark style="color:yellow;">The teacher method</mark> - To tell and show what should be done. This addresses the immediate situation but restricts development and can introduce dependency. By assisting the person with their learning you reduce dependency on the answer and increase their ability to learn. This should use open questions, and allow someone to search options to establish their goal. Coaches encourage people to think for themselves. When challenges arise - challenge others to solve them instead of jumping in. Provide support ,feedback, and guidance.

We don’t remember much of what we’re told. We should be told, shown, and do it. Coaching is investing time in staff development to save time later.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Neurogenesis</mark>\
Doing something new, not doing something you already know how to do better. Build new pathways / roads to new places. Learning is connecting patterns that you would otherwise miss.

Unhealthy brains are insular. A healthy brain has a wider circle of you

<mark style="color:yellow;">Barriers</mark>

You don’t want to focus on their problems or challenges but rather perceive them. DIscover their limits and empower them to create change.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Responsibility</mark> <a href="#j60rbxr3ahe8" id="j60rbxr3ahe8"></a>

Responsibility has to be truly accepted. If responsibility is accepted, performance rises. When ordered to be responsible or told to be, we don’t fully accept it and performance doesn’t rise. Giving advice can result in blame if the advice doesn’t work and they’re not responsible for the outcome. When advice is a commander, ownership is zero and can lead to resentment. Giving a choice grants acceptance and ownership. Telling someone denies them ownership.

If we acknowledge we are responsible for something, it allows us to have power and influence over it. It’s the ability to respond. Victim positions are when things happen to someone or are forced upon them. Victimhood diminishes responsibility and leads to blaming others.

The client’s life is a product of their own choices. Questions evoke self-discovery that ultimately helps them develop greater autonomy.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Awareness & communication</mark> <a href="#wz1aviplvnh2" id="wz1aviplvnh2"></a>

When noticing thoughts you don’t want - let them go. Acknowledge a thought and let it pass like something floating on a stream. Allow it to be there and let it go. Use intention to guide your attention.

By encouraging the person to imagine future coaching sessions, they’re future pacing and priming themselves for the coming learning. A good coach doesn’t tell, they ask questions - the skill is in the interrogation.

Awareness is observational - why and how are analytical so should be avoided. Body awareness brings automotive self-correction.

Both parties need to know where they stand and what is expected to happen. It’s vital that the points raised are actioned afterwards. Coaching is encouraging ownership of responsibility by all individuals. The objective is to embed a structure of planned development to align with company goals. Encourage the team to take responsibility for situations. Empower them to do more. Coaching improves productivity, morale, and job satisfaction and decreases dependency.

Awareness is being focussed, concentrating, and having clarity. It is the gathering and clarification of information and to determine what is relevant. It is understanding dynamics, relationships, people and psychology. Awareness is also self-awareness. The coachee needs to know that you’ll be encouraging them into greater insight and perspectives.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Projection and transference and countertransference</mark> <a href="#l9fhvoth8zj5" id="l9fhvoth8zj5"></a>

These are psychological distortions we should minimise.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Projection</mark> - projecting your negative or positive traits or perceiving them onto the other person.\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Transference</mark> - filtering the relationship through childhood significant relationships.\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Countertransference</mark> - The coach reacts to the other person transference with his own.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching with GROW</mark> <a href="#z79dysrxlt79" id="z79dysrxlt79"></a>

Goals come before reality because reality before goals reframes the goal in context of the limitations of the current situation. Goals first gives the greater freedom and creativity.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Goals**</mark>

End goal - a long-term final objective. Victim to circumstance and other variables

Performance goal - Mostly up to the person with a higher chance of success. It’s easier to commit to.

End goals should be supported by performance goals. Goals given don’t allow for proper ownership and aren’t effective. Setting your own goals gives you ownership and appreciation for the process. Self-motivation blossoms under choice of responsibility. Focus the attention towards doing something, not from avoiding something bad.

SMART - specific, measurable, agreed, realistic, time based

PURE - positively stated, understood, relevant, ethical

CLEAR - challenging, legal, environmentally sound, appropriate, recorded

Goals should sit between realistic and challenging. The best chance of success is if the person gives themselves

Coaching should be descriptive, not evaluative and detached. Once the person has to stop to think, they’re probing for new knowledge and insight. If trying to get someone to see their own problems, a light touch can help them arrive at the answer themselves.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Reality**</mark>

A good question is “what action have you taken on this so far?”

Resist the temptation to more onto options - goals and reality need to be explored properly.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Options**</mark>

The quantity of options is more important than their quality. They can be filtered down later. Limiting options reduces creativity. They need to be written down to come back to later

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Will - Action**</mark>

This is the final phase to convert discussion into action. This is about activating the will of the coachee. They must maintain ownership and choice. When are they going to do it? It needs to be an actual tangible time and date. What obstacles might be encountered and how can they be cleared? When and how are you going to get support? What steps?

Get the coachee to rate their intention to followup out of 10. Accept nothing below an 8. Coaching sessions should have an agenda. Sessions should be recorded in some way. The coachee should take the notes to make them responsible for their development.

Linking coaching to results - what benefits have you had? What effect does coaching have? If you weren’t coached, where would you be? If you continue with the new behaviour, where will you be? Things might get worse before they get better which is natural which we need to be prepared for.

We want to encourage the coachee to continue learning and developing by building on what they’ve learned. This gives long-term benefit. Coaching sessions should have an end. Begin with the end in mind.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching with OSCAR and OSKAR</mark> <a href="#id-46mz3h3w5ju" id="id-46mz3h3w5ju"></a>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching high performers</mark> <a href="#id-91q2lppn0gtu" id="id-91q2lppn0gtu"></a>

Discover and cultivate long-term goals\
Get experienced members to coach inexperienced ops\
Generate self-generated feedback

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Effectiveness & Metrics</mark> <a href="#wvlg2scypwaa" id="wvlg2scypwaa"></a>

Measuring effectiveness is essential for driving performance. Maximising success should include increasing coaching scope with increasing availability to create a coaching culture. Coaching needs to be supported from the very top down and available to everyone. All leaders should benefit from coaching. Companies should develop their internal coaching capability. Coaching is a discipline, a complex set of practical skills requiring refinement and evaluation. You can’t just “have a go”. Good coaching is about creating a high performing culture, not managing low performance.

By creating robust coaching metrics and linking them to organisational objectives and performance, it becomes easier to demonstrate the utility of coaching. Set some coaching KPI’s.

Coaches can benefit from in-house training or external management programs. Companies should offer this. Being a line manager doesn’t make someone a good coach. Coaching without support or coaching development may restrict the coaching scope or even be harmful. Coaching requires work and improvement as it’s like any other management skill. Aptitude and willingness aren’t enough - without work to improve and support structure coaching will struggle.

Culture change has to be performance-driven for the company to accept it. Switching from directing to coaching changes blame to evaluation, external motivators to self-motivation, change is welcomed, fire-fighting gives way to strategic thinking.

Coaching for success is collaborative and both must be working to make change together. You aren’t there to fix problems or know the answers, you approach coaching assuming they know the answer and it’s your job to get them to realise it through ownership and awareness.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Quotes</mark> <a href="#top5f9v4dfj7" id="top5f9v4dfj7"></a>

“If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.” - Einstein

“A paradigm shift occurs when a question is asked inside the current paradigm that can only be answered from outside it” -Marilee Goldbery

“You can’t solve a problem with the same thinking that created it” - Einstein

## <mark style="color:red;">Useful questions</mark> <a href="#k5mllnlga6jf" id="k5mllnlga6jf"></a>

***

How you ask questions is just as important as what you ask. Begin with the end in mind.
