**1 - Getting the best from employees**

A coach is someone who helps another person reach higher effectiveness by creating a dialogue that leads to awareness and action.

The Success Equation

Aptitude - The know-how, skills, capacity

Attitude - Drive, confidence, focus, outlook

Available Resources: Tools, equipment, time

Attitude refers to things like the drive, confidence, focus, chutzpah, enthusiasm, grit, determination, need, desire, fortitude, and inspiration to accomplish a task at hand. Although difficult to measure and manage, without the right attitude, having only the aptitude and available resources will get you nowhere.

\-Improved attitude can compensate for deficiencies in aptitude or resources

\-A decrease in aptitude or resources often negatively affects attitude, which can further hinder the level of success

\-The converse of the above is not true - a negative attitude does not decrease the level of aptitude or available resources

Attitude is the keystone in the success equation. All of these factors combined make learning how to improve someone’s attitude an extremely important skill. Managers need to be aware of, work to manage, and learn to develop the attitude (the determination, motivation, focus, drive, confidence) of their employees.

As a manager, one of the most important business imperatives you have is managing and developing the talent of your organisation. If you don’t, chances are the talent will go elsewhere, which costs your organisation a lot of money.

Poor management results in huge costs to an organisation. A disturbing truth for managers is that most of the time, when people quit their jobs, they are not leaving an organisation; they are leaving their manager.

Taking the time to manage and develop the talent of one’s employees is a critical business imperative for managers of all levels. To do so, one must focus on the entire success equation - aptitude, attitude, and available resources.

**2 - The what, thy, and when of coaching**

“When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”

How many times have you seen managers swoop in and try to “fix a little drop” with a heavy-handed approach that leaves things worse than they were before? They step back, wind up, and WHACK! They turn everything into a mess. Managers need a variety of tools in their well-appointed toolbox - and they need to know how to diagnose which situations call for which of their approaches.

What is the tool of coaching?

Managers should use coaching as a tool when an employee has the skills and ability to do the specific task, but for some reason they are struggling with the confidence, focus, motivation, drive, or bandwidth to deal with the situation in a manner that is as effective as possible.

To be effective, a manager has to really want to see the employee succeed, and they must hold the belief that their own success is connected to the success of the employee.

For the most part, managers are where they are in life because they are good at fixing things. They are so used to fixing problems that they often don’t put themselves in the role of helping other people fix it for themselves.

The goal of the entire coaching process is to lead to higher levels of effectiveness.

If we are not aware of the impact of our actions, thoughts, and feelings, then we have no reason to take action and start behaving any differently. As individuals, we spend most of out time in a reactive state.

When to coach and when not to coach

Learning how to recognise when and when not to coach is as important as learning how to coach.

Is it about aptitude? Yes - Teach. No ->

Is it about attitude? Yes - coach. No ->

Is it available resources? No - start again, Yes ->

Is there a lack of skill regarding dealing with lacking resources? Yes - teach, no ->

Do they get in their own way dealing with lacking resources? Yes - coach, no - start again

If the employee needs skills, teach them, but be sure to do it while utilising coaching skills such as concern and listening. If they need help with their attitude, coach them, but be prepared to offer suggestions and teaching tips along the way.

The trick for managers is to be able to look at a situation and then use the right mix of teaching and coaching that is required to get the employee what they need.

**3 - How to coach and W.I.N B.I.G**

The coaching process

1. Coaching is used when dealing with the attitude component of the success equation
2. To help enhance someone’s attitude, one must first help the person gain an awareness of what is going on and then move them to action by helping them devise different strategies

You will drive yourself and your employees crazy if you try to coach at the wrong time - just as you’ll drive them crazy if you don’t coach them when you should.

If one is not aware of one’s actions and the effects of those actions, then why or how should they change?

Having someone become aware means nothing if they take no action. The third part of what you do as a coach is help the coachee move to action and then hold them accountable to their commitment.

Questions are the backbone and lifeblood of a coaching dialogue.

Remember that a manager’s job while coaching is not to fix anything, not to give advice, not to tell the employee what to do. The coach’s job is to build awareness and move to action.

Because of the important role that questions have in the success of coaching, we want to explore the role of curiosity and the art of asking good questions.

Determine coachability - Is it about aptitude, attitude, or resources?

Build awareness - What’s really going on? What do they want?

Move to action - What will they do? How will I know?

Coaching questions

The only way to help another person enhance their attitude and thereby reach higher levels of effectiveness is by creating a dialogue that leads them to awareness and action. This dialogue is created not by telling, but by asking.

Questions\
1 - Keep them open\
2 - Keep them advice-free\
3 - Keep them short and simple\
4 - Keep them thought-provoking

5 - Keep them forward-focused

Starting questions with words such as “will”, “did”, and “have” will likely lead you into a closed-ended question. Try to rephrase those question to start with words such as “what”, “who”, and “how”.

As a coaching, you cannot be attached to the solutions you provide.

Keep them short and simple

In our experience, the most powerful coaching questions are often the shortest.

At the end of a coaching conversation, an employee will not talk away remembering your beautifully phrased questions. What they will remember is that you listened to them and they felt heard.

What do you want? What will that get you? What’s stopping you?

If you ever get stuck and seriously can’t think of a question, say “I’m not sure what to ask. What question should I be asking you?” Most of the time, the person will ask a question that moves them to a new level of awareness or action.

Keep them forward-focussed

One of the ways people’s attitude is affected is by replaying past events. As a coach, you want to help the employee step back from the events, learn from them, and then focus forward.

People need to complain before they can create. This is important for managers to remember. Allow people to vent for a few minutes and the acknowledge what they’re going through before moving them to a place of problem solving.

Rephrasing “why” questions

Why did you do that? -> What were you hoping to gain?

Why did you tell her that? -> How did that work out for you?

Why are you going to run six more samples? -> How will running size more samples increase your confidence?

The W.I.N B.I.G coaching formula

**W**onder about the root cause - Discovery

**I**nvestigate wants - Visioning

**N**ame possible solutions - Problem solving

**B**uild a plan - Action

**I**nsure action - Accountability

**G**ive affirmation - Validating

W - Wonder about the root cause - Discovery

It’s easy to get caught up in the problem or crisis. It’s easy to see that sales are decreasing, for instance, and assume that the sales team must be the problem. However, 99% of the time, what you see if just a symptom, not the real problem.

So take the time to help your employees wonder and discover. Remember, you are building their awareness to increase effectiveness. Be curious and playful, and keep thinking Discovery Channel until you feel as though you have gathered enough information about the feelings and the root cause and then move on to stage two - Investigate wants.

I - Investigate wants - Visioning

Next, it’s time to look at what the person wants to have happen, how they want to be as things move forward, and what they want as the outcome.

What do you want? How would you like people to describe you as the result of this? What would success look like?

If you could use a magic wand to recreate the scheme, how would you want it to look?

It is important to spend a few minutes getting the person to focus on how they want “to be” as they go about doing what it is they want “to do.” Help the person focus on what they really want from the situation and who they want to be as they do it.

Part of developing people is helping them grow into the vision of who it is that they want to be in their career and in life. Without a clear vision of how they want to handle the situation at hand, they will probably problem-solve it using the same approaches they always have, getting the same results they’ve always gotten, and not developing at all.

Deep down, we all know what we want. We just don’t always get a chance to voice it.

Because people can be so wrapped around the axle, they sometimes will say they don’t know what they want. If you get an “I don’t know” to one of your questions, respond by saying, “that’s fine, make it up”.

N - Name possible solutions - Problem-solving

Remember that you are still trying to build awareness, so the goal of this stage is to help the person become aware of the magnitude of possible solutions and choices that they have in the situation as they move toward their vision.

It can be difficult for some employees to reject an idea from their manager. If you think that might be the case, your statements could be qualified with prefaces such as, “This probably isn’t it, but you could…” or “I’m not sure about this, but what if you…” This will open the door for them to more comfortably push away your ideas.

Essentially, as a coach, you don’t want the person to accept your idea - you want them to take it and build on it so that it becomes their own, more-improved version.

The 85 year-old version of you is looking back. What will he say?

What are some ways to make that happen? What do you have to do to get where you want to go?

What would it take to work this out?

Inspire your employees to think bigger and consider different options.

What else? That’s a great idea, what’s another? Great, let’s think of five more.

So which option gets you closest to what you want? What would be the effects of your favourite solution?

It is possible that the employee will come up with a solution with which you disagree or can’t support because of the business repercussions. If that’s the case, say something like, “That’s a possible solution; here’s what I can get behind and here’s what part (and why) I can’t support. What else could get you where you want to go that takes those concerns into account?”

Move to action - B.I.G

If you never move to action, you have done nothing but have nice conversations with your employees. The goal is concrete action - doing things differently to reach higher levels of success.

B - Build a plan - Action

You’ll notice here that your questions begin to get more specific and, to a certain degree, more closed-minded. It is fine to ask, “Will you do that by next Friday?” The answer will probably be yes or no, and that’s fine at this stage because you need specifics.

Goals and tasks often need to be chunked down to manageable pieces; otherwise, the person gets overwhelmed and gives up.

Challenge ideas

I’m going to do this five times -> Great. Could you make it nine?

I will talk to this person by next Friday -> How about this Friday?

I could announce this next meeting -> Could or will? How about sending an email this week?

Not every coaching conversation has to end with a change-the-world type of plan; sometimes committing to observation for the sake of self-awareness can be a huge action step.

Be specific and don’t be afraid to throw out a challenge or two.

I - Insure action - Accountability

Your goal here is to insure action by establishing an accountability system. Having the coachee say they are going to do something is not enough. Here, you want to ask specific questions like:\
\-How will I know? -When will you let me know how it goes? -How much time do you need before a check in?

\-How will I know if you need a nudge? What’s the best way for you to circle back to me?

\-What should I do if you don’t get back to me? -How would you like me to follow up if I don’t hear back?

\-If you don’t follow through, how should I help get you back into gear?

Some people prefer an email reminder, some want a personal visit because they respond well to pressure. Talk about what will work for the person, and then make sure that if need be, you do it! The key here is to do it compassionately and frankly.

Insuring action puts some responsibility back on you. It’s the part of the coaching process in which you have an action item. You will have to do whatever it takes to keep your end of the bargain. Be sure that what you commit to is realistic given your schedule. Not following up can send a bad signal to the employee and set you up for future problems.

Sometimes the person does everything they committed to do exactly as planned, sometimes they drag their feet and do it late, and sometimes they don’t do it at all.

What stopped them? What got in the way of the follow through? How do they explain missing the deadline to themselves? Do they believe their excuse? What are the feelings around that?

Do your best to stay curious about why the employee is still in their own way. Do your best to want the best for them and to see them succeed. Do your best not to judge their efforts and instead, try to feel compassion.

Follow up to insure actions

The “action” of a coaching conversation does not happen during the conversation; it begins when the conversation ends and the coachee sets out to do something differently than before. Even more important id for you to follow through on your follow up!

G - Give affirmation - Validation

Take the time to give affirmation and acknowledge their hard work and their desire to grow and change. Your purpose here is to validate the goals, efforts, and plans that the person is putting forth and to validate the strengths and qualities that you see, think, or know will make them succeed as they move forward. This is a time for you to encourage, inspire, and motivate.

They want, and need, to know that you believe in their ability to make the change they committed to. They need to hear you say that you know they can do it, because chances are they are doubting themselves on some level - or else they would have done it already.

When you give affirmation, be prepared to follow it with a brief pause. People are not used to hearing good things about themselves, and for many people, receiving validation is actually an uncomfortable experience. When you are in this stage, or or anytime that you are pointing out someone’s strengths, take a few seconds at the end of your statement and “let it land.”

**Coaching frequently asked questions**

No matter how long it takes, coaching should never feel rushes.

The only linear aspect about coaching is that you should always build awareness before you move to action.

During a coaching conversation, people may get angry, sad, or happy - the key is to let them feel their emotion.

If, for some reason, you start to feel uncomfortable, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that the person is completely capable of taking care of themselves.

If all else fails, go back to the basics: 1. Build awareness - what’s really going on here? And 2. Move to action - so, what are you going to do about it?

If, however, you are fairly certain the employee’s solution will not succeed, a good approach is to use what we call the ALT-alt flow of conversation (Affirm, Like, Trouble, Alternatives). In this model, you affirm the employee’s thinking, that what you like about the proposed solution, explain what troubles you about the solution, and then brainstorm alternatives that address your concerns.

You don’t have to like the ideas your employees come up with, but you do have to tell them in a way that empowers them and keeps them returning to be coached.

**The tenets of Coaching**

Mindset

The first seven tenets are the lens you look through when coaching. They will help you approach a coaching conversation with an open mind, allowing both you and the coachee the necessary space to create an effective coaching conversation.

1. Believe in potential - the coachee has the potential to handle their situation
2. Be unattached - the coachee has the best answers for their problems
3. Don’t know and don’t fix - you don’t have to know and you aren’t there to fix anything
4. Keep it light and fun - engage and be creative
5. Stay curious - continue without judgement and non attachment
6. Trust your gut - listen to gut reactions and get the coachee to acknowledge their own
7. Build awareness before action - build a good process before acting

Coaching actions

There are some specific things you need to do and different skills you need to apply during a coaching conversation. These tenets are the practical aspects of coaching.

1. Mirror - you are the mirror helping the coachee reflect
2. Listen - focus on the coachee 100%
3. Create space - prepare before the session and coach in a place without distraction
4. Validate - acknowledge the coachee’s strengths in tackling their issues
5. Ask - ask open-ended questions and empower the coachee
6. Feedback - give specific feedback on behaviour
7. Celebrate - acknowledge their accomplishment

Tricks of the trade

You won’t need to use these tenets in each coaching conversation. However, you may need to keep them in mind do that when the occasion arises, you can use them appropriately.

1. Bottom line - summarise a point in 2-3 sentences
2. Word choice - monitor own language and point out red flags the coachee uses
3. Story shift - get the person to look at alternative perspectives
4. Coach the person - keep the attention on the coachee, not someone else
5. Deal with resistance - ask detached questioned even if encountering resistance
6. Address fears - identify the person’s fears that stop them moving forward
7. Create vision - help the person determine their vision and work towards it

Believe in potential

\-When is the person at their best?

\-When have you caught a glimpse of what they are capable of?

\-Jot down some of the characteristics and traits that you saw in the person at the time

\-If the person has the ability to be focused, productive, charismatic, and funny during that time, what is it theta keeps me from seeing them this way more of the time?

Responses and followup examples

No, I don’t think that’s it > Great, what do you think it is?

I’m not sure that’d work > OK, what would work?

I don’t think I could do that > Well, what could you do?

Don’t know and don’t fix it

Good managers delegate well, communicate well, and see the bigger picture at work.

Your job is to help the coach see the bigger picture of their issue, and help them believe that they know everything they need to know to find the solution they’re looking for. Your job is to ask questions that prompt them to do their best thinking.

When you coach someone, it’s OK (and even encouraged!) to say that you don’t know the answer and trust that they do know the answer, even if they don’t think they do. This not only empowers them, enabling them to grow and develop, but it also allows you to move forward in your own work, rather than delving into the minutia of theirs.

Response and followup

I don’t know how to fix this problem > What’s the biggest thing standing in your way?

I’ve tried everything; nothing is working > OK, take a step back. What haven’t you tries / done yet that you know you really ought to do?

I think we need to start from scratch > Great. What would that look like and how would it affect the project timeline?

Keep it light and fun!

People learn best when they’re having fun and interacting. So it’s OK to show your silly side; it helps your coachee lighten up too.

Stay curious

Response and followup

I missed my sales targets again. I need help > Yeah. So what are the things that are getting in your way?

This project is much more complicated and difficult than I expected > What has you hung up the most?

I don’t know. She’s just driving me crazy > Sounds like she is stepping on something you value, like your commitment to quality, perhaps. What is it?

Trust your gut

The best managers use their instincts to guide their actions. If something doesn’t feel right to them, even if it looks good on paper, they investigate it further to see if anything is missing or miscalculated.

When you coach someone, it’s OK to bring your instincts into the conversation. The key is not to get attached to the outcome.

Your job is not to tell them to trust your instincts and insist that your instincts are right; your job is to put it on the table and let them tell you what they think.

By listening to your instincts and stating what is going on for you, you allow the coachee to examine themselves and move to a different level of problem solving.

Response and follow up

I think that changing the report format will help matters > I just got an adrenaline rush when you said that. What does your instinct tell you about this possible solution?

I want you to tell accounting to bill our #1 client a late fee. What do you think? > I always trust my instinct when making important decisions about clients. What does your instinct say about this client?

The numbers look good for this project, but my gut tells me not to do this > What is your gut telling you to do?

Build awareness before action

The quality of our end product is greatly affected by the process we follow to get there. Without a good process, accomplishing the task at hand is difficult.

The best managers take time to think about the process, as well as the task.

Response and followup

The IT department is delaying my work all the time > What else would be causing the delays?

I can’t work with Sue. She’s impossible > What’s the real issue in your dynamics with Sue?

I’m overwhelmed with my workflow; it’s too much > What do you think is causing the work overload?

**The seven tenets of coaching actions**

Mirror

You have to act like a mirror and paint a picture of what is going on and let the employee interpret or react to what they see.

Hold up the mirror and explain to the coachee what you’re seeing. It will unblock their blind spots and move them to new solutions.

When mirroring, concisely and matter-of-factly explain what you heard and saw, without any judgement or condemnation. Then ask the coachee to interpret what is in the mirror. The key is to stay detached from their answer; you just want to act like a mirror for them, allowing them to see what you see.

Listen

The key to successful listening is to remove all distractions, sit back, and focus 100% on the coachee’s words, emotions, and body language. You then want to tell the coachee what you heard in all three of these areas so they can use that information as they solve their own problems.

Create space

Creating space is one of the fundamental tenets of successful coaching. First of all, clear your area of all physical distractions.

In addition to office interruptions, “create space” also means clearing your head and preparing yourself mentally for the coaching session.

Validate

If you’re coaching someone, you’re helping them deal with something that they have not dealt with on their own. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but it is for them; otherwise, they wouldn’t be asking for your help. Validation can give people the confidence and motivation to get through their challenging situations.

The key to successful validating is to speak what you believe to be true regarding the coachee. It’s important to remember that it’s not about you and how they’ve impressed you. The validation is about them and their inner strength and power.

Feedback

Be specific, be focussed on behaviour, focus on the impact of that behaviour, help them determine alternative behaviour that leads to an alternate effect, and speak in a matter-of-fact manner, without judgement or condemnation.

**Tricks of the trade**

Bottom Line

A coach’s job is to get to the bottom line as quickly as possible, even if it means cutting some people off before they finish their story. This is necessary because often people think that “the story” is the real issue, when most often it isn’t.

Validating a person’s emotions after a bottom-line response can help them move on even more quickly. “Wow, that sounds really frustrating” lets a person know you heard them and help them prepare to move on.

Word choice

Why: Asking “why” can put someone on the defensive, shutting down the conversation instead of opening it up for creative solutions.

Should: Using the word “should” places your thoughts, judgements, and solutions on the coachee, instead of allowing them to create their own solution.

Not/Can’t: Using the words “not” and “can’t” creates a negative spin to the coaching conversation, limiting your belief in the coachee’s potential.

Red-flag words\
Always -> Sometimes

Everyone -> Some people

All the time -> Sometimes

Never -> Rarely

Can’t -> Won’t / choose not to

Some of these red-flag words are: always, never, everyone, can’t, and all. These words tend to be gross generalisations, based on a story and not on fact. When a coachee uses these words, they are usually living out a story in their head, instead of living out daily reality.

Story shift

Everyone has a story, or a perspective, on a situation. You could have ten people in the same room at the same time, involved in the same event, and you’d have ten different stories on what happened, none of which is totally right or wrong. However, the problem comes when we get attached to one story and think that our personal story is the only one, or the right one.

Coach the person

An effective manager focuses on coaching only the coachee, not anyone else that the coachee may mention during a conversation.

The more attached they are to their story, the more they will need to look at different perspectives to find tier solutions.

Your job is to focus on the coachee and not get distracted by anyone that the coachee talks about. This allows the coachee to focus on themselves, how they get in their own way, and how they can get out of their self-imposed box.

Deal with resistance

Self-management is the key when coaching someone who is resistant. You need to know how to manage your own buttons so that if the coachee accidentally pushes them when talking about their problem, you’ll still be able to focus on them 100%.

When your buttons get pushed by someone’s resistance, just notice that your mind is wandering and try to bring it back to the coachee.

Be curious about their resistance and worry about yourself later, when you’re done coaching.

When someone is resistant, your job is to be curious about the problem. Continue to ask open-ended questions and really listen and mirror back what you hear and see.

Response and followup

I don’t know the answer to that question -> That’s fine. What do you know to be true about the problem at hand?

This is a waste of time -> What would have to happen for it to be a better use of your time?

It’s pointless to talk about this -> OK. So what’s the outcome of not dealing with it?

Create vision

Every manager needs to know the organisational vision, so that they can steer their team in the right direction to achieve the company’s goals. By the same token, every manager needs to know their individual team member’s vision and goals as well.

Don’t judge or mock the fear; just point it out and ask open-ended questions so the coachee can identify the fear and decide the next step.

**How to use this book**

1. Clear distractions
2. Clear your mind
3. Ask open questions

7. Don’t know and don’t fix it - realise that you don’t have to know the answer
8. Don’t get attached
9. Remember, awareness before action
10. Follow up

**Coaching employees and colleagues**

**Set Up**

Determine Coachability

The first thing to do is to ask yourself if this is a situation that is appropriate for coaching.

Coaching is appropriate when the person has the ability and most of the skills to handle the situation (aptitude), but for some reason, they are in their own way of getting the job done )attitude).

Explain the tool

People are fine with managers using tools; they just need to understand what the tool is and how you will use it. So don’t just spring this book and all of these questions on people.

**Build awareness - W.I.N**

W - Wonder about root causes

Pick a question from the wonder about root causes section. Follow up by asking a powerful question of your own that takes you deeper into their answer.

I - Investigate wants

Pick a question from the investigate wants section and ask it. If the person feels stuck, then either ask another question from the section to keep the momentum going, or ask them what’s making them feel stuck.

N - Name possible solutions

Pick a question from the problem-solving section. The conversation should have the feel of a brainstorming session. Pick as many questions as you need, or ask your own, to get the person to think through multiple ways of solving the problem.

**Move into action - B.I.G**

B - Build a plan

Always start by asking the first two lead-in questions listed in this section: “which of the possible solutions gets you closest to what you want?” followed by “which one do you think you should pursue?”

I - Insure action

Ask a series of questions from the accountability section that help you both clarify how the coachee will complete the commitment and what is needed from you to support them. Be sure to ask the closing question of this section, “so, in summary, what will you do by when, and how will I know?”

G - Give affirmation

By sure to answer it in a way to validate the efforts your employee is making at that moment.

**Using the book to coach yourself**

Keep a journal of your coaching thoughts and periodically review your insights - you’ll be amazed at how much you’re learning!

1 - Determine coachability - Is coaching the best option?

2 - Get prepared - grab a journal and find a quiet spot

3 - Pick a chapter - specific situation, chapter 6; general situations, chapter 7.

Take the time to acknowledge what you are learning - give yourself the credit you deserve.

**W.I.N B.I.G questions for specific coaching**

Common issues managers face:\
\-Interpersonal problems

\-Motivation

\-Time management

\-Dealing with conflict

\-Clarifying goals

\-Lack of available resources

\-Developmental opportunities

\-Life balance

\-Conflicting priorities

\-Delegation

\-Increasing confidence

Wonder about root cause

Use the wonder about the root cause section as a way to ensure that you are coaching about the real issue, and then move on.

Investigate wants

In this section, your goals is to help the employee clarify what they really want from the situation and whom they want to be as they move in that direction.

Build a plan

Which of the possible solutions gets you closest to what you want?

Which one do you think you should pursue?

Insure action

Your goal here is to help the employee hold true to their commitments by establishing an accountability system.

Give affirmation

Real validation has to come from you, not a book!
