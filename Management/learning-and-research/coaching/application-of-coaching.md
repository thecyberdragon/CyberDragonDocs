# üìÑ Application of Coaching

## <mark style="color:red;">**Stage 1 - Foundation Session**</mark>

***

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Overview</mark>

Sets up the coaching agreement and creates the basis of future sessions. Explains the format of sessions and what coaching is.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching 101</mark>

Coaching is unlocking people's potential to maximise their own performance. It is helping them to learn rather than teaching them.

Supporting people to grow themselves and their performance, clarify their purpose and vision, achieve their goals, and reach their potential. Awareness and responsibility are increased through inquiry, purpose exploration, and self-realisation. Coaching focuses on the present and future, is a complete partnership between coach and coachee, and sees the coachee as whole (not broken or needing fixing), resourceful, and able to find their own answers.

Coaching without goals is chit-chat.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Agreements</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Confidentiality**</mark>: Who engaged me and relationship to the coachee. Who I‚Äôm accountable to. Communication flows through the coachee. Documented and shared with them.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Permission**</mark>: Asking it, co-active relationship building (trust, honesty, safety). Purpose is forward the action and deepen the learning. I care about the coachee and them taking action, not the road they take to get there. Learning, discovery and insight over punishment and blame.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Values and Motivations</mark>

Ask them to recall pivotal moments in their life before the session and explore here.

Extract the motivations and values it shows and use that as a base for future sessions.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">**General**</mark>

Values discovery

Strengths discovery\
Metaphors that inspire the coachee

Mindset and limiting beliefs

Design the Alliance

What are the conditions that need to be in place for the two of us to work together effectively?

What would success look like for us working together? What would the worst-case look like?\
What‚Äôs the best way for us to work together to achieve success? What do we need to be mindful of?

What attitudes do we need to bring? What permissions do you or I want? What assumptions are there?

What will we do when things get hard?\
How can we be more productive? How can we both take responsibility for making this work?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Ongoing Design**</mark>

What is working and what is not?

What do we need to change in order to make the coaching relationship more effective or have more impact?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Between sessions</mark>

It is important to keep a record of desired outcomes, actions, and timelines committed to and check back in at subsequent sessions to follow up on those actions.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Homework Inquiry</mark>

The homework inquiry is often posed at the end of the coaching session and is meant to give coachees time for continued reflection and exploration.

Here are some examples:\
\-What is the underlying yearning?\
\-What are you here to do? To create?\
\-What are you resisting?\
\-What is it to be inspired?

The homework inquiry is a potent tool in coaching because it takes the coaching out of the session and integrates it into the coachees life.

My choices post-foundation session:\
\-What would fulfilment look like?\
\-What would success look like?\
\-What would you love to become?\
\-Who would you like to become?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">GROW Overview</mark>

Goals - Clarifies the desired end result from the session\
Reality - Where you currently are. Internal obstacles and blocks (limitations)\
Options - What you can do to achieve the goal\
Will - Refined action steps. Outlining future obstacles. Set accountability (who needs to know). Set followup.

Types of Goals: From inspiration to action\
Progress goals - SMART steps - serves all goals below. What actions will you take?\
Performance goals - Tangible milestones - Serves below. What will you deliver?\
End goal - A clear target - What are you aiming to achieve? Manifestation of the dream.

Dream goal - Purpose and meaning - WHat‚Äôs the bigger picture? Vision - the big why

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Will Tips</mark>

Merely sharing your intended action with another person often has the effect of ensuring that you do it.

It is no good wanting some support but not taking the steps necessary to get it.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Intuition</mark>

It‚Äôs the in-the moment nudge that quickly fades. We attach an interpretation to that intuition.

We should both act on our intuition. Interrupting is OK. Let me know if it becomes too jarring.

Notice and play with intuition.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Homeostasis</mark>

When the old way is undone and the new way is not yet embedded, there is a strong pull back to the familiar, the known, even if it didn‚Äôt get coachees the results they wanted. FIght it.

Top 10 powerful questions

1 - If I wasn‚Äôt here, what would you do?

2 - If you know the answer, what would it be?

3 - What if there were no limits?

4 - What advice would you give to a friend in your position?

5 - Imagine having a dialogue with the wisest person you know or can think of. What would they tell you to do?

6 - What else?

7 - What would you like to explore next?

8 - I don‚Äôt know where to go with this. Where do you want to go?

9 - What is the real issue?

10 - What is your commitment on a scale of 1-10 to doing it? How can we make it higher?

## <mark style="color:red;">GROW feedback framework</mark>

***

In order to make feedback a learning opportunity, the key questions to ask are: what happened? What did you learn? How will you use this in the future?

Acknowledgement recognises the inner character of the person to whom it is addressed. More than what that person did.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Set intention</mark> - goal questions and context for feedback\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Recognise</mark> - Focus on what they did well and build strength\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Improve</mark> - Non-judgement is the key to safe learning. Give them space to reflect\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Learn</mark> - Check in on learning and set actions linked to development goals

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Golden rule**</mark>: coachee shares first, coach adds their perspective second

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Chemistry meeting</mark>

The chemistry meeting is where you meet the coachee for the first time and is usually free of charge. It is an opportunity for both you and your coachee to check that you feel you are a good match to work together. It is customary to let each other know after the chemistry meeting if, on reflection, you feel you are a good fit or not. If not, don‚Äôt worry - sometimes the chemistry is just not there.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching for an inner conflict</mark>

When a coachee has an inner conflict of some sort, you can ask ‚ÄúWhat part of you wants to do that?‚Äù and then ‚Äúwhat other characteristics does that part have? What does the other part want?‚Äù The purpose of these coaching questions is to help coachees to recognise and understand more about their drives and their inner conflicts as a prelude to resolving them.

You should be able to ask them to list some names for their subpersonalities.\
Which one of these do you find most disruptive? Under what circumstances does this one show up?\
Give me an example of a recent time. What did it want at the time?\
Did it get it? And if so, how do you think the other person felt?\
What would be another way of getting what you want in those circumstances?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">How to reach alignment - Self-Mastery</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Step one</mark>: Recognise that you have subpersonalities at all, identifying your most active ones and when they take you over.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Step two</mark>: Willingness to acknowledge to another person or people that conflicting subpersonalities exist, and to discover when they show up and take you over, what they want, how they limit you, and how they may serve you.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Step three</mark>: Get them to cooperate with one another, and this is where inner alignment starts.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Step four</mark>: The final stage is true synthesis or collaboration to the same end for the good of the whole. While this kind of developmental process can be undertaken at home through self-reflection, meditation, and visualisation, the processes themselves need prior experience or training.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Structured daydreaming or visualisation</mark>

Many advanced coaching methods seek to reach beneath the rational, logical, and limited mind into the subconscious, which is a whole system. Guided imagery can be used in structured daydreaming or visualisation to have coachees imagine themselves on a journey up a mountain, an archetypal symbol for growth; suggest to them that they meet certain things on the way, from gifts to obstacles, from an animal to a wise old teacher; and ask them to image what happens when this occurs.

This is something you can do with your coachees. It‚Äôs recommended to say it unprepared and spontaneously when you are confident enough, as it will sound more authentic.

When coachees have finished this visualisation and after a breather, coach them on the experience, focussing mainly on what the obstacles symbolised to them and what qualities they deployed to overcome it. What was the animal and what were their feelings about it? What was the conversation with the animal, and what did that symbolise?

The whole journey up and down taking, say, 15 minutes. The debriefing will be as long as a piece of string.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching mindset</mark>

The coach believes that the coachee is capable, resourceful, and full of potential. Believing in the dormant capability of a person will build their self-belief and self-motivation and enable them to flourish. And with that mindset, you can coach them to make their own powerful choices and find enjoyment in their performance and their success.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Gremlin</mark>

The personification of a belief that blocks us from moving forward. The coaching perspective is that the belief developed to keep us safe and that by becoming aware of it we can choose how it impacts our life. Rick Carson's book Taming your gremlin is excellent for clearing gremlins.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Permission</mark>

By asking if the coachee is happy to be coached in sensitive, intimate, or new areas, or before offering a hard truth or speaking to a gut feeling, the coach creates a safe environment, helps to build trust, and makes sure coaching remains a partnership.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Coaching questions toolkit</mark>

The golden rule is to be clear and brief. Sometimes the most powerful questions lead to a long silence, so don't feel the need to jump in with another question if there is a long pause.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-coaching</mark>

What would you like to work on? What would you like to have after answering this set of questions?\
What is your first goal related to this issue? When are you going to achieve it?\
What are the benefits for you? Who else will benefit?\
What actions have you taken so far? What is moving you close to your goal? What is moving you away from it?

What options do you have? What else could you do? What are the pros and cons of the options?

What will you act on? When are you going to start each one? Who can support you?

How committed 1-10 are you on each step? What will you commit to doing?

The golden rule for feedback is that in each step of the framework the coachee shares first and the coach adds their perspective second.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Goal</mark>

* What do you want to get out of this?
* What would be helpful for you?

Coach: I want‚Ä¶.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Reality</mark>

* What is going well?
* What did you like about what you did or how you did it?
* What worked well? What behaviours were most effective?
* What do you think contributed most to your success?

Coach:

* I liked‚Ä¶.
* I found what worked well was‚Ä¶.
* I felt that you consistently surpassed goals and expectations by‚Ä¶.
* I recognise the effort you put into‚Ä¶
* Strengths that I see are‚Ä¶.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Options: Improve</mark>

* If you could do it again, what would you do differently?
* What behaviours would you change next time?
* What got in the way of you achieving?
* What would enable you to achieve greater consistency/quality in the future?
* Where specifically over the past year would additional skills or experience have been helpful?

Coach:

* Can I make a suggestion?
* I feel you could stretch yourself by‚Ä¶
* How about‚Ä¶?
* Ways to further leverage your strengths would be to‚Ä¶.
* The reason this developmental area is important is‚Ä¶.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Will: Learn</mark>

* What did you learn that you can apply going forward?
* What are you learning about yourself?
* What are you learning about others?
* What do you now know about this goal that you didn‚Äôt previously?
* What else can we learn?

Coach:

* I am learning‚Ä¶.
* I will do‚Ä¶..

## <mark style="color:red;">**Coactive Coaching Framework**</mark>

***

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**2: The co-active coaching relationship**</mark>

Goals change over time as coachees clarify what is important, as they dig deeper into what motivates them, and as they take action and learn from the actions they take.

The goal for an effective coaching conversation is a relationship environment that is as clear and as quiet as possible.

1- It is safe enough for coachees to take the risks they need to take

2- It is a courageous place where coachees are able to approach their lives and the choices they make with motivation, creativity, and commitment.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Trust</mark>

An agreement to hold the coaching conversation confidential is one key component in building trust. Trust is also built over time as both coachee and coach learn they can be counted on and the coachee learns that the relationship delivers results.

You are here. Where is here?

This discovery phase focuses on where coachees are today and how they got there.

Coachees and coach might talk about previous disappointments and successes in order to get an idea of what does and doesn‚Äôt work, where coachees are fulfilled, and the strategies they use to handle obstacles and derailment.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Curiosity: Steering through curiosity</mark>

If there is a reason to be curious about the past or survey the background, it might be to look for patterns or themes that are useful in the present conversation. This is not so that coaches have a better understanding about what happened; it is so coachees have a better understanding of what they value, the way they make decisions, and how they preserve or sabotage themselves.

Sometimes the most powerful questions are the ones that sound the dumbest, or, if you prefer, simple and profound.

Here are some ‚Äúdumb‚Äù questions:

* What does success look like (or feel like)?
* What‚Äôs next?
* What about that is important to you?
* What else?
* What did you learn?
* What will you do? When will you do it?
* Who do you need to be?

There are times when you may think the questions i too dumb to ask - the answer is so obvious. Go ahead and ask it, and be open to being surprised. Even if you get the answer you expect, remember that the reason for asking is not so you can hear the answer; it is so the coachee can hear the answer and learn from it.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Curiosity: Not-so-powerful questions and exceptions</mark>

When it comes to making questions powerful, the simpler and more direct, the better.

A compound or complex questions forces coachees to sort out the essence of the question before they can respond, and they may get lost trying to figure it out. The powerful question is powerful because it cuts through to the heart of the issue.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Forward and deepen: Main</mark>

Action will look very different for different coachees. For some coachees, it will mean achieving specific goals or performing at a higher level. For others, action means integrating new practices or firmly establishing new habits. For still others, it will be paying attention to the more subjective quality of their lives. In whatever way coachees define action, it will be a focus in their coaching.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">F\&D: Accountability</mark>

As coaches, we hold coachees accountable - not to see them perform or even measure how well they perform, but to empower them in making the changes they want to make. Along the way, we celebrate their achievements and dig into the obstacles they encounter.

Whether a person fails or succeeds, one of the underlying goals is always to look at the learning that results from the experience.

Celebrating failure doesn‚Äôt mean ignoring the disappointment that often accompanies it. Coachees may need a little time to absorb the bump before they can dig into the learning that is available there.

Goal setting falls into two main categories: first, goals to reach at a specific time in the future and, second, ongoing goals.

They are action oriented, even if the intention behind the action is qualitative. For example, the goal ‚Äúthink about moving to Alaska‚Äù will be strengthened by action. The coachee could buy a book about ALaska, find a poster that features Alaska, write in her journal about her memories visiting Alaska, or talk to someone who lives there. And when there is a schedule involved, coachees are much more likely to take action.

The moment you become attached to the brilliance of your own idea and start thinking it‚Äôs the right way for the coachee to get results, it‚Äôs your agenda, not the coachee‚Äôs.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">F\&D: Putting structures to work</mark>

A structure is any device that reminds coachees to be in action in the areas they have committed to.

Structures come in a myriad of forms. Setting an alarm to wake up is a simple example of a structure - it reminds you what time it is: time to get up!

The power of the structure is that it reminds coachees and recalls them to their commitments.

* Create a special screen saver with a theme line or visual image
* Track daily or weekly progress towards major goals on a wall chart
* Establish creative consequences or rewards

Structures are a way of sustaining the action and learning in the time between coaching sessions.

When you find yourself trapped in self analysis - defending, judging, feeling annoyed - the alarm bells should be going off. When you find that you are hooked or caught up in personal emotional reaction, you are no longer with your coachee; you are with your own level 1 reactions, thoughts, and feelings.

Take a hard look at the areas in your own life where you get tangled up - where you see a pattern of historical trouble for yourself. Chances are, those are the same areas you are unwilling to probe in the coaching sessions. For you, they are blind spots, created out of self-protection.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-management: Disconnected? Say so</mark>

In that moment of disconnect, one of the most powerful things you can do is to admit it: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry; I just went blank for a moment. Would you repeat what you just said? I missed that.‚Äù

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-management: Be ready</mark>

This is about being prepared for the upcoming coaching session in the usual ways you would prepare for any important conversation. It would be as simple as reviewing your notes from the most recent coaching session. More than that, in order to be present and ready, many coaches have a ritual they use before the appointment.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-management: Recovery</mark>

Clearly, the most obvious skill for the context of self-management is the skill of recovery: the ability to notice the disruption or disconnection and to reconnect.

There are three parts to the skill: noticing, naming, and reconnecting.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-management: Asking permission</mark>

One of the most important techniques the coach uses to remind the coachee that they are in charge of the coaching direction is to ask permission.

Championing is an affirmation. It is your capacity to see their capacity. It is a form of future looking. You see them at the finish line, the top of the hill, goal accomplished.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-management: Clearing</mark>

Imagine that your coachee is clearly annoyed about some injustice. There‚Äôs a mood about her that hangs in the air like an unpleasant odour. You might say, ‚ÄúYou seem really blocked. Let‚Äôs take a couple of minutes to get this out. Really complain, whine, feel sorry for yourself. Exaggerate.‚Äù

Coachees often feel awkward about just venting and want to quit before they‚Äôre completely clear. So you must really push until the last gasp of bad air is out.

Fulfilment: Values, not morals or principles

What is to be admired is not the value itself but your coachee‚Äôs ability to live that value fully in his or her life.

The question is What would it take to be fulfilled? Then keep probing in that direction. Whatever comes up, follow it with What else? Or Tell me more. The idea is to uncover deeper and deeper levels of meaning and, from time to time, to clarify what you hear and play it back to your coachees so they can heat what they‚Äôre saying.

For managers, a variation on this exercise is to have the employee design a ‚ÄúWheel of life at work,‚Äù with each of the areas a significant part of the person‚Äôs work and career.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Balance: Stage 4: Commitment</mark>

Before you invite coachees to take action, make sure they‚Äôve really made a commitment to their plans.

Commitment implies there is no turning back. This is the point where you draw a line and ask the coachee to cross into new territory. Will you commit to that plan and take action? Will you do that?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Process: Process coaching</mark>

Sometimes the way forward involves going down into the experience first.

The flow in process coaching has the following steps\
1 - The coach senses the turbulence under the surface and names it\
2 - The coach explores it\
3 - The coachee experiences it\
4 - A shift happens\
5 - Energy opens up\
6 - The coachee has access to new resources\
7 - Movement happens

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Process: 2 - The coach explores it</mark>

Once you have heard and named the turbulence, the next step is to explore the territory - but first you must ask the coachee for permission.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Process: Going up into it</mark>

Coachees can be so driven to move on to the next stage or the next project or challenge that they want to skip the celebration of their accomplishments - and miss the chance to discover more about themselves and the keys to their success.

As a coach, part of your job is to listen for the kind of avoidance that keeps your coachees from experiencing the whole range of musical notes available to them.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Process: To be with</mark>

A word or two is in order about the expression ‚Äúbe with,‚Äù which is often used with process coaching. We might say, for example, that the coachees are ‚Äúbeing with‚Äù disappointment, or the coach is ‚Äúbeing with‚Äù coachees and their disappointment.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Putting it all together</mark>

We might think of the three principles as three different tools. When coach and coachee explore values, a future vision, or the self-sabotage that can keep coachees from achieving their vision, the coach is pulling from the fulfilment toolkit. When the coach helps coachees look at an issue from a variety of different viewpoints or consider plans or action options, the toolkit is balance-based. The coach who forms a container around the current moment and delves more deeply into it is in the general area of process.

‚ÄúYou tell me if I go too far‚Äù.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">The expanding world of coaching - Coachee relationships</mark>

It is the three-way dynamic created between the coach, the coachee, and the organisation. In this case, the coach needs to design a three-way alliance. Issues of confidentiality must be defined and roles clarified. Does the organisation expect a report from the coach or the coachee? Who sets the goals and criteria for the coaching - coachee or organisation?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Workplace coaches</mark>

It is especially important for workplace coaches to be clear about the boundaries for the coaching relationship.
