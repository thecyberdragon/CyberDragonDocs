Introduction

Coaching is chiefly about discovery, awareness, and choice. It is a way of effectively empowering people to find their own answers, encouraging and supporting them on the path as they continue to make important choices.

A co-active conversation has inherent ground rules regarding certain qualities that must be present: respect, openness, compassion, empathy, and a rigorous commitment to speaking the truth.

The co-active model

We start with this assertion: people are, by their very nature, naturally creative, resourceful, and whole. They are capable: capable of finding answers, capable of choosing, capable of taking action, capable of recovering when things don’t go as planned, and, especially, capable of learning.

Of course there are times when the circumstances feel overwhelming, when even the most resilient human beings feel that the mountain is too high, the road to cross too wide, the effort simply not in their power. Circumstances and that inner sabotaging voice that says “why bother?” or “you don’t have what it takes” can leave anyone feeling much less than creative or resourceful, and just a fraction of whatever whole is. On these days more perhaps than on any others, it is our place as coaches, our gift is to see the true, natural selves who were and are still capable. We remind them of their own inner light and help them find it again - because it is there. Naturally.

Focus on the whole person

Leaders manage people, not just problems. Developing talent and creating a more resourceful and effective organisation creates sustained results, long after the presenting problem is solved.

When a coach is sitting across from a coachee, the coach is not sitting across from a problem to be solved; the coach is sitting across from a person.

This person is more than the problem at hand - or the goal, the dream, the task. This is a whole person: heart, mind, body, and spirit. And this issue, whatever it is, is not neatly isolated. It is inexorably intertwined in the coachee’s whole life.

Sometimes what the mind says yes to, the spirit feels at a loss with.

There is a spirit dimension that influences human choices. At the core, it includes the sense of living according to values, or a calling, or a power greater than ourselves. Sometimes it is intuition, a feeling in our gut, and sometimes it is a conviction that we know we must live by.

No topic exists in isolation. A decision is one area of life inevitably ripples through all areas of life.

Dance in the moment

Every conversation creates tone, mood, nuance. There is as much information, sometimes more in how the words are said versus the words chosen; sometimes there is more information in what is not said than what is said.

Evoke transformation

Coaches in this model hold a vision that sees the topic as an expression of something even more valuable to the coachee. This action at hand is the means to a higher end; it should lead to a a life fully lived in whatever area the coachee finds important.

There is a yearning for the very best, the full potential that the coachee can experience. And when that connection ignites between today’s goal and life’s potential, it is transformative. Now the report, or the job interview, or the 5k race are more than a checked box on a to-do list. They are expressions of inner conviction. The accomplishment is a message about who the coachee can be.

Coaches play a key role, by holding a vision of what is possible and by their commitment to transformative experience.

By taking a stand for the greatest possible impact from even the smallest action. Coaches encourage - and ultimately evoke - transformation.

The heart of the model

The choices we make during the day, no matter how trivial they may seem, contribute to creating a life that is more (or less) fulfilling. The decisions we make move us toward or away from better balance in our lives.

Fulfilment

The coachee’s definition of fulfilment is always intensely personal.

It’s not about what fills the coachee’s pockets or closets; it’s about what fills the coachee’s heart and soul.

The coactive model:\
Curiosity & Listening - Naturally creative, resourceful, and whole

Listening & Intuition - Dance in the moment

Deepen - Focus on the whole person

Self-management - Evoke transformation

A fulfilling life is a valued life, and coachees will have their own definition of what they truly value.

At its deepest level, fulfilment is about finding and experiencing a life of purpose and service. It is about reaching one’s full potential.

Balance

Ultimately, balance is about making choices: saying yes to some things and no to others. This can be challenging. Coachees often want to say yes to more in their lives without making room for it by saying no to something else. This impulse leads to an overwhelmed feeling - and lives that are out of balance.

Process

We are always in process.

The coach is there to encourage and support, provide companionship around the rocks, and escort coachees through the dark waters as well as to celebrate the skill and success at navigating the difficult passages.

Designated alliance for an empowered coaching environment

Coachees play an important role in declaring how they want to be coached.

Listening

The coach is listening for the appearance of the coachee’s vision, values, and purpose. The coach is also listening for resistance, fear, backtracking, and the voice of the saboteur, who is there to object to change, point out the coachee’s shortcomings, and bring up all the reasons why this idea, whatever it is, won’t work.

Intuition

Intuition is a skill that needs practice and development. It is enormously valuable because, time and again, it synthesises more impressions and information than we could ever analyse consciously.

Curiosity

The coach‘s job is to ask the questions, to lead the discovery process.

Because the coach is not an inquisitor but is really on the coachee’s side in the exploration, the coach can ask powerful questions that break through old defences.

Forward and deepen

Coaching is not just about getting things done; it is just as importantly about continuing to learn, especially to learn how the action is or is not contributing to the core principles.

Self-management

In order to truly hold the coachee’s agenda, the coach must get out of the way - not always an easy thing to do. Self-management is the coach’s ability to set aside personal opinions, preferences, pride, defensiveness, and ego.

Self-management is about awareness of impact. In the course of a coaching relationship, coachees also learn about self-management in their own lives. They experience the modeling and develop their own awareness of impact insight.

The coach’s role in the model

We see coaching, especially the form presented here, as a role of service that requires commitment and presence on the part of the coach.

To be present there, in that conversation, contributing to that change is enormously gratifying. It fulfils a sense of higher purpose in the coach’s life. Making a difference - helping others to achieve their dreams and reach their potential - this is why coaches are drawn to this work.

The co-active way: A broader application of the model

The most effective leaders see a whole person with potential, and they view the issue in the moment as an opportunity for development. The skills and awareness that you develop through this practice have the power to help you create new levels of empowered and effective relationships.

**2: The co-active coaching relationship**

Goals change over time as coachees clarify what is important, as they dig deeper into what motivates them, and as they take action and learn from the actions they take.

Powerful coaching is not about being a powerful coach; it is about the power the coachee experiences.

The coach invests power into the relationship, as does the coachee, but the coachee is the only one who receives it.

The coaching environment

The environment in which the conversation takes place is crucial. By environment, we mean both a physical environment and a relationship environment that is made up of ground rules, an understanding of expectations, and mutual agreements that support the coaching process.

The goal for an effective coaching conversation is a relationship environment that is as clear and as quiet as possible.

1- It is safe enough for coachees to take the risks they need to take

2- It is a courageous place where coachees are able to approach their lives and the choices they make with motivation, creativity, and commitment.

The trust and assurance that is built into the relationship is more than a safety net. It is a dynamic springboard of support that allows individuals to reach for what otherwise might seem unreachable.

Confidentiality

If coachees are going to risk making significant change, they must be able to risk talking freely with their coach. Courageous disclosure is crucial because it leads to the discovery that is necessary for action.

Trust

An agreement to hold the coaching conversation confidential is one key component in building trust. Trust is also built over time as both coachee and coach learn they can be counted on and the coachee learns that the relationship delivers results.

Speaking the truth

It is a place where the coach expect the truth from the coachee because truth carries no consequence other than learning, discovery, and new insight.

Coachees expect the truth from the coach because that is the inherent promise in the coaching relationship. Coachees are often so close to their own situations, so wrapped up in their own histories and habitual patterns, that they are sometimes unable to see the truth accurately.

Openness and spaciousness

This is a place where coachees can breathe, experiment, fantasise, and strategise without limitation. It is a space in which they can vent their anger, troubles, spite, perceptions, of injustice, and regrets. It is a place where failure is acknowledged as a means for learning, where curiosity and creativity replace rigid rules and historical absolutes.

For the coach, spacious also means complete detachment from any particular course of action or any results that coachees achieve. Coaches continue to care about their coachees (e.g, their agenda, their health, and their growth) but not the road they take to get there, the speed of travel, or the detours they might make along the way - as long as they continue to move towards the results they want.

The designed alliance

In simplest terms, the design of the alliance looks at questions such as What are the conditions that need to be in place for the two of us to work together effectively? What are the obstacles or potential obstacles? What fundamental questions need to be answered in order to get the most out of this process? And as the coaching continues, there will be ongoing questions: What is working and what is not? What do we need to change in order to make the coaching relationship more effective or have more impact?

Coaching flourishes best in a culture where a coaching conversation is commonly practised and understood for its contribution to helping everyone be more successful.

Getting Started

This foundation-setting process familiarises coachees with the coaching process, provides an opportunity to design the alliance, and begins the work of clarifying coachee issues and goals.

In this initial work, coachees learn what to expect from coaching. It is also a time for them to clarify where they are, where they’re headed, the strengths they will use to get there, and the obstacles that often interfere.

Areas to cover:\
\-Logistics

\-You are here. Where is here?

\-Designing the future

\-Orientation to coaching

Logistics

One of the first, obvious elements in getting started is communication and agreement on fundamental ground rules and administrative procedures.

You are here. Where is here?

This discovery phase focuses on where coachees are today and how they got there. It’s a conversation about where they are and the issues at hand, what is at stake, what moves them, what blocks them.

Often, the coach will make an overall assessment of satisfaction in the significant areas of the coachee’s life using the wheel of life:\
Physical environment, career, money, health and wellness, friends and family, significant other, personal growth, fun and recreation

Coachees and coach might talk about previous disappointments and successes in order to get an idea of what does and doesn’t work, where coachees are fulfilled, and the strategies they use to handle obstacles and derailment.

Where do you usually get stuck? Leads to a logical next question, How would you like me to respond as your coach when you’re stuck?

Designing the future

These future outcomes will be the result of achieving goals, fulfilling commitments, changing habits, and bringing a compelling vision to life. The initial conversation also explores who the coachee will be in order to create that new future.

Just as important to achieving results is putting new practices in place. Eliminating life-draining habits while implementing sustaining, life-giving practices is another important focus of the coaching process.

Compelling vision

Discovering what draws us has the power to overcome the bonds of lethargy and fear. Finding the compelling vision can take any goal, action, or outcome and invest it with new power.

Who do you need to be

In order to achieve the results they want, coachees very likely will need to change attitudes, paradigms, or underlying beliefs. The beginning of a new coaching relationship is an ideal time to peel back the accumulated layers of identifying the old roles to uncover the authentic person within.

Orientation to coaching

A clear, forthright conversation helps reinforce frank, unrestrained, and hence co-active groundwork.

Homeostasis

When the old way is undone and the new way is not yet embedded, there is a strong pull back to the familiar, the known, even if it didn’t get coachees the results they wanted.

Change requires the expenditure of energy, and continuing the process of change requires sustaining energy. Some change will be easy; other change will not be so easy. There will often be a tendency, or a temptation at least, to backslide.

Every individual, whether a private coachee or an organisational coachee, lives within a system, and the system itself often contributes to the resistance to change.

The neuroscience of coaching

Coaching activates the imagination and elists the power of curiosity. The neuroscience research reinforces what coaches have known from experience: where the attention goes, energy flows. And that energy is generative. It actually creates new neural pathways - new attitudes, new beliefs, new expectations, and, over time, new results that are sustainable because they are built on those neural pathways.

Transformative coaching is the natural, very human result of thoughtful consideration and emotional stirring and commitment.

The bigger picture

In order for coaching to work, there must be commitment on the part of the coachee to exploring, changing, learning, taking risks, persevering even when it is difficult, and investing the time and energy. Coachees must be willing to go beyond their comfort zones and step into the unknown for the sake of change. Without commitment, coaching drifts and devolves into chitchat ot to-do lists that often don’t get done.

The coach who is committed to coachees and their ultimate goals is willing to challenge, incite, motivate, encourage, and sometimes insist that coachees take charge. This is the cornerstone of evoking transformation in action.

Co-active contexts

In the flow of the conversation, the coach uses instinct and training to draw on one of the five competencies.

Listening: Main

When another person is totally with you - learning in, interested in every word, eager to empathise - you feel seen and understood. People open up when they know they’re really being listened to; they expand, they have more presence.

Team leaders and team members often engage in conversation on a superficial - but often important - level where the pressure is on state the problem, evaluate the options, choose a solution, and move on as rapidly as possible. Sometimes that’s all that’s needed. However, if it’s the only form of conversation that happens, then in the linear race to the finish line huge opportunities for creative exploration and collaboration - the opening for constructive consideration and harvesting learning - are lost.

Listening: Awareness and impact

We are multifaceted receivers with many receptors of various kinds, all of which are taking in information. We notice the pace of delivery, the pitch and tone, the modulation of voice. We sense the pressure behind the words - the voice might be soft or hard edged, tentative or enraged. We listen not only to the person but, simultaneously, to everything else that is happening in the environment.

When you listen with awareness of your impact, you are not thinking about what you take in or what you’re going to do with your awareness. Your listening is hyperconscious and subconscious at the same time.

Listening: Level 1

At level 1, our awareness is on ourselves. We listen to the words of the other person, but our attention is on what it means to us personally.

At level 1, there is only one question: what does this mean to me?

Another indication that you are operating at level 1 is a strong desire for more information. You want answers, explanations, details, and data.

The possibilities for a cocreated, collaborative solution vanish as the leader or manager listens only to his or her own thoughts, analysis, and opinions about what’s best, in a compelling drive to answer the question.

Level 1 informs us about ourselves and what’s going on around us. It’s also where we figure things out and understand.

Listening: Level 2

At level 2, there is a sharp focus on the other person.

You listen for their words, their expressions, their emotions, everything they bring. You notice what they say, how they say it. You notice what they don’t say. You see their smiles or hear the tears in their voices. You listen for what they value. You listen for their vision, for the unique way they look at the world., You listen for what makes them come alive in the coaching session and what makes them go dead or withdraw.

Level 2 listening is the level of empathy, clarification, collaboration.

When you connect at level 2, it’s as if the message is I have time for you. Not just I have time to address the problem but I have time for you .

Listening: Level 3

When you listen at level 3, you listen as if you and the coachee are at the centre of the universe, receiving information from everywhere at once.

Level 3 includes the action, the inaction, and the interaction.

Level 3 awareness is something described as environmental listening.

Performers develop a strong sense of level 3 listening. Stand-up comedians, musicians, actors, training presenters - all have the ability to instantly read a room and monitor how it changes in response to what they do.

Think about the impressive, inspiring leaders you’ve known or observed. It’s almost certain they were skilled at level 3 listening - awareness and impact and the ability to dance with whatever just happened. Reading the environment is a key leadership competence.

Listening: The coaching is listening

Listening, then, is the gateway through which all coaching pases.

What part of the issue just needs to be handled efficiently with my resource or answer? And where in this conversation is there a development and learning opportunity?

Listening: Articulating

When you combine that sense of what is happening right now with what you know about this coachee, you have a tremendous amount of information. Articulation is the ability to succinctly describe what is going on.

By not sidestepping the apparent disconnect between personal promise and actual behaviour, you live up to your coaching commitment. Articulating - as in pointing out the disconnect - is part of the coach’s job. Cleaning up the mess is the coachee’s job.

Listening: Clarifying

Many of us have a tendency to operate from vague or incomplete thoughts and unresolved feelings. We may leap to conclusions or draw conclusions based on sketchy information.

The skill of clarifying is a combination of listening, asking, and reframing. Sometimes it’s simply testing different perspectives.

Listening: Meta-view

Meta-view presents the big picture and opens up room for perspective.

When they’re struggling at the foot of the mountain, looking up at the daunting work to be done, meta-view allows them to float above it and get a fresh perspective.

Listening: Metaphor

Metaphor provides rich imagery for exploration, and if the metaphor doesn’t hit the mark in a way that increases insight, coaches can always try something else.

Listening: Acknowledging

The coaching skill of acknowledgement strengthens the coachee’s foundation. The coachee can stand straighter after a true acknowledgement. This skill addresses who the coachee is. By way of contrast, praise and compliments highlight what people do.

Acknowledgement recognises the inner character of the person to whom it is addressed. More than what that person did.

Acknowledgement is almost a context of coaching. At some level, coaches are always supporting who coachees must be in order to make the changes they say they want to make. The coachee had to be courageous, or had to be a person willing to stand up to the fear, or had to be tenacious for the sake or relationship.

The skill of acknowledgement helps the coach celebrate the coachee’s internal strengths. Acknowledgement helps coachees see what they sometimes dismiss in themselves out of a distorted sense of humility, or simply don’t see at all. By acknowledging that strength, you, as the coach, give coachees more access to it.

Notice the impact on the coachee. This is a way for the coach to make sure that the acknowledgement was truly on target. Notice the coachee’s reaction. By listening at level 3, you will now if you found the right description of who the coachee had to be in that situation.

Intuition: Main

In a co-active context, the purpose for instinct is to support the coachee; it is not instinct for the purpose of giving advice. When you find that your attention is on figuring out the solution, shift to the person and the conversation in front of you.

Intuition: But is it right?

One way of looking at intuition says that it is neither right nor wrong - it’s more like a nudge we receive.

In order to express our intuition in words, we make an interpretation. It’s our interpretation of the intuitive nudge that can be off-target.

In the end, intuition is valuable when it moves the coachee to action or deeper learning. It is irrelevant, really, whether your intuition was correct.

Intuition: Intuitive intelligence

The key seems to be to take a soft focus, to be open. Your intuition is there, giving you messages or clues, just below the surface. This is the paradox of intuition: an open hand will hold it; it slips through a fist.

Intuition: Observation and interpretation

When you speak from that intuition you use words, and they are your best effort in the moment to package the nudge. You are communicating an observation - and you are also declaring an interpretation: in that hesitation it sounds like something is being held back. If you jump right to your interpretation, it will too often come out a sa conclusion, an accusation, or a judgement.

If you’re going to use your intuition effectively, you can’t be attached to your interpretation.

The key lesson: do not be attached to your intuition, no matter how certain you feel. Being attached to being right is something you do for your sake. Coaching is for the sake of the coachee.

Intuition: Blurting it out

Intuition is like a small flash of light that is already beginning to fade as soon as it appears. The most powerful moment is the first.

Intuition: Getting the intuitive hit

The source of the intuition is irrelevant. When is relevant is what happens for the coachee.

Intuition: Intruding

It’s best if you prepare your coachees for these types of intrusions at the beginning of your coaching relationship. Explain that you’ll sometimes interrupt the conversation in a way that make surprise them.

You may need to interrupt, and you ask that they not take it personally. Ask them to let you know if they feel offended. Ask them to let you know if they feel offended so that the two of you can talk about it again if necessary. This should be all the permission you need, as coach, top intrude whenever it seems appropriate.

Intuition: Blurting

It’s better to dive in and be willing to look a little clumsy. This often builds trust than if you are the always polished, professional authority, always in control. Being clumsy or messy, and therefore more human, is also more authentic.

Intuition: Coachees and their intuition

As you teach coachees to work with intuition, begin by asking them to spend time noticing their intuition and playing with it.

Curiosity: Main

Being genuinely curious and eager to play with whatever shows up is at the heart of a co-active relationship.

Curiosity: A different way of asking

Curious questions are open, expansive, provocative, and exploratory, sometimes piercing through many layers. They invite exploration, reflection, and discovery. They prompt a search for information but in a way that runs deeper than the usual, conventional information-gathering questions.

There is a big difference between conventional questions that elicit information and curious questions that evoke personal exploration.

The answers to information-gathering questions will give us the address on the door, but they don’t open the door to a rich, rewarding experience of engaging conversation. Only curious questions will do that.

Curiosity: The value of curiosity

Curiosity generates the search, defines it, and directs it, but it is the exploring that creates learning. And it is the kind of learning that lasts, because it comes from within.

With questions that imply a correct or a purely factual answer, we search our inner files for the response that fits: the right answer. With curiosity, we have the experience of exploring, uncovering, digging around, considering, reflecting. This is the learning that leads to sustainable change and growth.

Curiosity: Building the relationship

Curiosity builds relationships; interrogation builds defences.

Curiosity: Steering through curiosity

If there is a reason to be curious about the past or survey the background, it might be to look for patterns or themes that are useful in the present conversation. This is not so that coaches have a better understanding about what happened; it is so coachees have a better understanding of what they value, the way they make decisions, and how they preserve or sabotage themselves.

Curiosity: Powerful questions

Think of questions as points of a compass. Asking a powerful question is like sending the coachee not to a specific destination but in the direction filled with possible discoveries and mysteries.

Curiosity: Using powerful questions

To ask powerful questions, the coach must be very curious and very courageous on the coachee’s behalf. The coach needs to assume that the coachee has the wherewithal to handle even tough, direct questions.

Sometimes the most powerful questions are the ones that sound the dumbest, or, if you prefer, simple and profound.

Here are some “dumb” questions:\
\-What does success look like (or feel like)?

\-What’s next?

\-What about that is important to you?

\-What else?

\-What did you learn?

\-What will you do? When will you do it?

\-Who do you need to be?

There are times when you may think the questions i too dumb to ask - the answer is so obvious. Go ahead and ask it, and be open to being surprised. Even if you get the answer you expect, remember that the reason for asking is not so you can hear the answer; it is so the coachee can hear the answer and learn from it.

Curiosity: Not-so-powerful questions and exceptions

When it comes to making questions powerful, the simpler and more direct, the better.

A compound or complex questions forces coachees to sort out the essence of the question before they can respond, and they may get lost trying to figure it out. The powerful question is powerful because it cuts through to the heart of the issue.

“Why” questions often unintentionally put coachees on the defensive. They feel a need to explain or justify a decision or point of view.

Given the right context and a tone that matches that context, a “yes-or-no” or “why” question can have a dramatic effect on coachees, calling them to their own commitment.

Curiosity: Homework inquiry

A homework inquiry is another special kind of question. In it’s phrasing, it can be identical to a powerful question. The difference is that the homework inquiry is often posed at the end of the coaching session and is meant to give coachees time for continued reflection and exploration.

What sets the homework inquiry apart is the scale of exploration - the depth that is possible - and the time available to reflect on the question: Several days, a week, or more.

Here are some examples:\
\-What is the underlying yearning?

\-What are you here to do? To create?

\-WHat are you resisting?

\-What is it to be inspired?

The homework inquiry is a potent tool in coaching because it takes the coaching out of the session and integrates it into the coachees life.

Curiosity: The power of being curious

In time, you get to know their interior workings until, ultimately, you become their voice, asking the questions they themselves would ask.

Forward and deepen: Main

Action will look very different for different coachees. For some coachees, it will mean achieving specific goals or performing at a higher level. For others, action means integrating new practices or firmly establishing new habits. For still others, it will be paying attention to the more subjective quality of their lives. In whatever way coachees define action, it will be a focus in their coaching.

Action and learning are what the coachee experiences. To forward and deepen is the job of the coach.

Every initiative and every issue that arises is an opportunity for team members to learn in the process of taking action.

F\&D: Authenticity

You, as the coach, must be yourself, so that coachees can feel the honesty and integrity of who you are. You will be their model of what risk-taking looks like, what it means to be real and honest.

Obviously it is important to take serious situations seriously and to behave professionally, but even so, there is plenty of room for lively engagement.

F\&D: Connection

Part of the coach’s job is to establish, monitor, and maintain the strongest possible connection signal with coachees. This signal strength is especially important when coachees are moving into new or uncharted territory in their work or their lives.

There will be times in the coaching when the coach takes a risk with the coachee: to challenge or to tell the truth. If the connection is strong, there will be trust and relationship and a greater opportunity for success.

F\&D: Aliveness

We are referring instead to a feeling in the atmosphere between coach and coachee: it feels very alive.

If you put the environment on a continuum, you might have words like dead, remote, and indifferent on one end, and alive on the other.

F\&D: Courage

How courageous are you willing to be on his or her behalf? Your willingness to be courageous will be a model, a mirror for your coachees.

This does not mean nagging, judging, or shaming them. It means speaking fiercely to the courageous part of your coachees while ignoring the part that is self-sabotaging.

F\&D: Taking charge

Your job as coach is to forward their action and deepen their learning.

F\&D: Accountability

As coaches, we hold coachees accountable - not to see them perform or even measure how well they perform, but to empower them in making the changes they want to make. Along the way, we celebrate their achievements and dig into the obstacles they encounter.

The accountability might take the form of a homework inquiry for daily journaling.

The same end-of-the-day reports might be sent to the coach by email along with notes about what the coachees are discovering.

F\&D: Celebrating failure

More than a lack of knowledge or skill, more than the lack of a clear strategy or action plan, the biggest obstacle in the way of progress for coachees is the paralysis caused by the fear of failing.

Whether a person fails or succeeds, one of the underlying goals is always to look at the learning that results from the experience.

Celebrating failure doesn’t mean ignoring the disappointment that often accompanies it. Coachees may need a little time to absorb the bump before they can dig into the learning that is available there.

F\&D: Coaching skills

The skillful coach will know when it is time to encourage the creative breadth of brainstorming and when it is time to light the fire for challenging.

Goal setting gives coachees a specific direction and an action plan for making something real. Naturally the goals may shift over time as coachees make progress, but movement in the first place starts with setting their sights on a goal or an outcome.

Goal setting falls into two main categories: first, goals to reach at a specific time in the future and, second, ongoing goals.

They are action oriented, even if the intention behind the action is qualitative. For example, the goal “think about moving to Alaska” will be strengthened by action. The coachee could buy a book about ALaska, find a poster that features Alaska, write in her journal about her memories visiting Alaska, or talk to someone who lives there. And when there is a schedule involved, coachees are much more likely to take action.

F\&D: Brainstorming

There are times when even good intentions and strong desire can be stalled by a simple shortage of ideas for action.

There are no bad ideas. Don’t worry too much about practicality at the brainstorming stage.

Coachees tend to propose ideas they have already thought about or minor variations on those ideas. You make the process more creative and fun by stretching the net of possibilities. The second ground rule is that coaches should not be attached to their own good ideas and, beyond all, should not use brainstorming as camouflage for pitching their own solutions.

Brainstorming is generative, so look for ways to build on ideas, not just take turns adding one more idea to the pile.

It will be appropriate at times for you, as coach, to request certain actions. Based on your training, your experience, and your knowledge of your coachee, you’ll have a sense - usually based on actions coachees are already considering - of what direction they might take for maximum learning.

In time, using this format, coachees learn that taking on a request is an act of personal commitment, not just acceptance of an assignment from their coach. The key to making a successful request is to not be attached to it. The moment you become attached to the brilliance of your own idea and start thinking it’s the right way for the coachee to get results, it’s your agenda, not the coachee’s.

F\&D: Challenging

A challenge asks coachees to extend themselves beyond their self-imposed limits - way out to the edge of improbability.

F\&D: Putting structures to work

A structure is any device that reminds coachees to be in action in the areas they have committed to.

Structures come in a myriad of forms. Setting an alarm to wake up is a simple example of a structure - it reminds you what time it is: time to get up!

Different structures appeal to different senses. Some are tactile: wearing that power suit to the board meeting. Some are visual: a picture on the office desk of a dream home or vacation destination. Structures can be auditory: a special piece of music as a personal soundtrack to help complete a project or enjoy a workout.

The power of the structure is that it reminds coachees and recalls them to their commitments.

\-Create a special screen saver with a theme line or visual image

\-Track daily or weekly progress towards major goals on a wall chart

\-Establish creative consequences or rewards

Structures are a way of sustaining the action and learning in the time between coaching sessions.

The reason for the structure is to provide discipline and focus in an area where it may be difficult for coachees to stay on track. By making structures playful, you increase the chances that coachees will follow through.

Exercise: requesting

Look behind any complaint and you will almost always find a request that could have been made instead.

There are always three legitimate responses to your request: yes, no, or a counteroffer.

Self-management: Main

The context of self-management is a combination of self-awareness and the skill of recovery. It is an awareness of yourself, an ability to notice where you are or where you have gone in relationship with your coachee, and it is about the ability to get back, to reconnect.

In a co-active relationship, self-management is an expression of your total commitment to that other person; it’s about creating the optimum one-to-one connection in the moment, which is why it holds an important place in the co-active contexts.

Self-management: Bumped off course

This ability to engage with coachees wherever they are when they show up for coaching is so essential to being an effective co-active coach that we have made it one of the four cornerstones: the ability to dance in the moment.

The context of self-awareness also involves knowing the difference between simply wandering along wherever the coachee leads, and holding particular focus with the coachee.

You may not always agree with your coachee’s plans, and yet the self-management course is to honour their actions as theirs: theirs to work with, to change as necessary, to fail at completely or succeed at gloriously, and to learn from, always.

For the sake of your own integrity, you may decide it’s important to share your reservations but with the caveat that you are offering your own experience and opinion, not “the right answer”.

When you find yourself trapped in self analysis - defending, judging, feeling annoyed - the alarm bells should be going off. When you find that you are hooked or caught up in personal emotional reaction, you are no longer with your coachee; you are with your own level 1 reactions, thoughts, and feelings.

Self-management: Forbidden territory

Self-management also includes where you stop or hold back in your coaching.

Coaches may hold back because they don’t want to risk offending, but what they risk instead is a less resourceful life for their coachees or simply weak, but polite, chitchat. Is it possible that a coachee will get upset and quit? Yes, it’s possible. If the coaching conversation isn’t stirring, it’s stagnant - missing the aliveness.

Take a hard look at the areas in your own life where you get tangled up - where you see a pattern of historical trouble for yourself. Chances are, those are the same areas you are unwilling to probe in the coaching sessions. For you, they are blind spots, created out of self-protection.

Self-management: self-judgement and good judgement

The key for you as a coach is the same key you give your coachees. First, notice. Make sure you record it well in your mind. What was the criticism or observation, precisely?

Something happened in there that hooked you and caused a reaction, and it’s worth paying attention to it.

The more adept you become at recognising and working with your own self-judgement, the more you’ll be able to help coachees work with theirs.

For managers working with team members, a comparable self-management situation would be one where using a coaching approach is simply not working in that relationship in spite of your best effort.

In the context of self-management, the lesson is to be aware. Don’t force, don’t judge, and look for alternatives for this employee.

Self-management: Disconnected? Say so

In that moment of disconnect, one of the most powerful things you can do is to admit it: “I’m sorry; I just went blank for a moment. Would you repeat what you just said? I missed that.”

Self-management: Be ready

This is about being prepared for the upcoming coaching session in the usual ways you would prepare for any important conversation. It would be as simple as reviewing your notes from the most recent coaching session. More than that, in order to be present and ready, many coaches have a ritual they use before the appointment.

The questions for any coach or any manager about to step into a coaching role are simply but essential: Are you ready? Or can you be ready?

Gritting your teeth and persevering when the going is tough is admirable - but only up to a point. Self-management is about knowing where that point is.

Self-management: Opinions and advice

You’re on the spot trying to figure out both the nature of the issue and how to be most helpful. You’re asking yourself, Who am I in this moment? Am I the boss? The subject matter expert? Confidant? Coach?

Ultimately, the question to answer as manager is, What will best serve this employee - now and in the future?

The approach to the presenting opportunity is a balance of What is there to learn here? As well as What is there to fix?

Sometimes the most efficient, expedient, and correct response is not another powerful coaching question; it’s an experienced solution. That’s the self-management context.

Self-management: The coach’s dilemma

Still, at times it may seem pointless to withhold your knowledge or experience when it is clearly relevant and could spare coachees time, money, effort, and anxiety.

As long as you are conscientious about framing the conversation as your experience and encouraging coachees to find their own best way while exploring a number of alternative pathways, your experience will be seen as one more potential course of action and not the “expert’s” way. In short, don’t make it a rule that you will never share an opinion or a bit of advice. Self-management is a context of discretion, always in the coachee’s best interest.

Self-management: Recovery

Clearly, the most obvious skill for the context of self-management is the skill of recovery: the ability to notice the disruption or disconnection and to reconnect.

There are three parts to the skill: noticing, naming, and reconnecting.

Notice it - It is important to simply notice the gap, the shift, the disconnect.\
Name it - Describe what just happened: “I got lost,” or “I was distracted for a minute.”

Reconnect - Fundamentally, it is the process of turning your attention back over to your coachee - that level 2 connection, engaged and present.

Self-management: Asking permission

One of the most important techniques the coach uses to remind the coachee that they are in charge of the coaching direction is to ask permission.

Asking permission is a sign of self-management on the coach’s part, and it allows coachees to take responsibility for managing the relationship and their work. Coachees are honoured when you ask permission; their boundaries are respected.

Self-management: Bottom-lining

We recommend that you describe the use of bottom-lining in coaching early in your work with coachees so they are not caught by surprise the first time you ask them to get to the bottom line.

You need to coach the essence, and asking coachees to get to the bottom line helps them discover the hearts of the matter.

As the coach, you should not be talking much. Your conversation should be bottomlined.

Self-management: Championing

You champion coachees by standing up for them when they question their abilities or their capacity to take on the task or challenge. It is not empty cheerleading. As the coach, you champion what you know is true; coachees will know if you aren’t sincere.

Championing is an affirmation. It is your capacity to see their capacity. It is a form of future looking. You see them at the finish line, the top of the hill, goal accomplished.

Self-management: Clearing

Imagine that your coachee is clearly annoyed about some injustice. There’s a mood about her that hangs in the air like an unpleasant odour. You might say, “You seem really blocked. Let’s take a couple of minutes to get this out. Really complain, whine, feel sorry for yourself. Exaggerate.”

Coachees often feel awkward about just venting and want to quit before they’re completely clear. So you must really push until the last gasp of bad air is out.

Self-management: Reframing

Coachees frequently get stuck with a certain way of looking at a situation or an experience. Their perspective, moreover, has a message that is in some way disabling. Your ability to reframe the experience provides a fresh perspective and a sense of renewed possibility.

Fulfilment: Main

A fulfilling life is a life of meaning, purpose, satisfaction.

One of the most valuable things we do for coachees is to help them get clear about that very personal shape of fulfilment and how it connects to this momentary question arising on the surface.

It’s important for coaches to understand the scale and impact of fulfilment as they begin their work with coachees.

Fulfilment: The hunger for fulfilment

A “Fulfilling life” is not something you attain by accomplishment or acquisition. It is a continuous process of creation. As long as we continue to look for things to define our fulfilment, we are likely to be temporarily filled and constantly hungry.

Fulfilment: To be fulfilled

Fulfilment is available every day of our lives

Working towards goals that make the vision real is also fulfilling right now, in this moment, because we are consciously moving toward a more fulfilled life. The point is that fulfilment is an exercise of choice and not something that will happen.

Coachees will still want to have things: a successful business, more money, romantic relationships. But these things are the expressions of their fulfilment. They are not fulfilment itself.

Fulfilment: Feeling good is not a sign

Some people will say that the times when they felt most fulfilled were times when they had the least, when life was a struggle. They were doing what was important to them - things that claimed their passion and commitment.

Living a life of purpose, mission, or service can be intense, sometimes heartbreaking and exhausting, and at the same time enormously fulfilling. The paradox of fulfilment is that it is possible both to have a sense of inner peace and to experience an outer struggle at the same time.

Fulfilment: To be alive

Fulfilment is the state of fully expressing who we are and doing what is right for us.

A word we use for this feeling is resonance. Life is vibrating at a frequency at which everything we most value is in alignment. We feel it in the choices we make.

That resonant feeling, when action and deep purpose are aligned, is an enormous engine for motivation as well. Making the connection fuels the desire and commitment and will help coachees when the hill is steep or the headwinds strong.

Fulfilment: Values, not morals or principles

What is to be admired is not the value itself but your coachee’s ability to live that value fully in his or her life.

You are modelling your values in every moment and so are the people who report to you. As a leader, your action - the decisions you make or don’t make, how you treat people, everything - is done under the sharp eye of those who report to you or who are under your leadership. They are watching you. By your action you set the tone and, in fact, reveal constantly what you value.

Fulfilment: Values clarification

Because our language is imprecise, it’s often easier to cluster values than to try to invest all the meaning in a single word. Thus, we might separate a series of value attributes with slash marks to indicate a grouping of value words that communicates a composite sense. For example, freedom/risk taking/adventure is different from freedom/independence/choice.

It’s not even important that you, as coach, understand exactly what coachees mean by the words they choose. It is enough that coachees are clear about what the words represent, so when they find they’re off track, the wording of their values can help set them back on course.

Fulfilment: The value of values clarification

The most effective way to clarify values is to extract them from the coachee’s life experience.

Because people tend to judge their values, they often list values they think they should have, like spirituality or integrity, and exclude the ones that society says are not so admirable, such as personal power and recognition.

Values are either present in or absent from the choices coachees make every day, which means that any given daily activity can be linked to a value honoured or a value betrayed.

Fulfilment: Coaching fulfilment

What was fulfilling at age twenty-five may have lost its fascination by thirty-five; the empire-building passion of thirty-five may give way to a search for inner peace by forty-five. It is important to help the coachee develop a clear picture of a fulfilling life as it is today.

The question is What would it take to be fulfilled? Then keep probing in that direction. Whatever comes up, follow it with What else? Or Tell me more. The idea is to uncover deeper and deeper levels of meaning and, from time to time, to clarify what you hear and play it back to your coachees so they can heat what they’re saying.

Wheel of life: Fulfilment\
Physical environment, career, money, health and wellness, friends and family, significant other, personal growth, fun and recreation.

For managers, a variation on this exercise is to have the employee design a “Wheel of life at work,” with each of the areas a significant part of the person’s work and career.

Fulfilment: Values and decision making

For you as coach, knowing the coachee’s values is a tremendous advantage. You can quickly see how certain courses of action will be blessed with a sense of flow and ease because the activities are congruent with the coachee’s values. By knowing when the coachee’s values are not being honoured, you can also see the potential iceberg in front of the Titanic.

A decision based on the coachee’s top values will always be a more fulfilling decision. It may not be the easiest or most enjoyable. It may require sacrifice and even have uncomfortable consequences. But on balance, over time, it will be the most fulfilling.

Fulfilment: Fulfilment and life purpose

People are looking for more than a job with a paycheck; they are looking or meaningful work where, at the end of the day, they can feel they contributed, they made a difference. Finding purpose at work can be enormously motivating and deeply engaging.

Finding and claiming a life purpose gives coachees a powerful sense of direction for their lives. The truth they find in the life purpose statement can make them virtually unstoppable.

Life purpose is about coachees using their talents as well as the unique learning of their lives, their experience, and their wisdom. A fulfilled life is one they are able to live with purpose - intentionally, not by accident.

Living a life of meaning and purpose is a rare accomplishment indeed, and in one sense it is the very definition of fulfilment.

Fulfilment: Dissonance

If a coachee is not making choices based on his or her values, then the effect will be some form of dissonance. It can be frustration, boredom, indifference, anger, resignation, or persistent justification for a course of action that looks very much like self-betrayal or martyrdom.

Be aware that whenever people take the initiative to change their lives, an alarm sounds and the saboteur will awaken. Expect it. You can even forward your coachees.

Fulfilment: Fulfilment and the coach’s role

The coach’s role is to challenge coachees to pursue their fulfilment, in spire of the circumstances, in spire of the voices all around them offering bad advice and contrary agendas, and in spite of the coachee’s own inner saboteur.

Balance: Main

In the big picture, fulfilment is about living a life that is valued, purposeful, and alive, and balance is about choosing a life that is in action, aligned with a compelling vision.

Coachees want to be more empowered and less at the mercy of circumstances and other people’s expectations and demands. They want to feel they are choosing their life, not just reacting to it.

What most coaches want is not to go faster or slower or to have less or more, but to have a life-giving ride supported on the rails of a fulfilling life vision. How they get that ride is the objective of balance coaching.

Balance: Day to day

Balance coaching starts with the way coachees look at the situation; the need for different action is not the starting point. The coachee’s point of view is often the main contributing factor to the blocked, stuck, or spinning feeling.

Balance: A formula for balance coaching

The formula for moving from stuck to possibility and from possibility to action has five steps: (1) perspective, (2) choice, (3) co-active strategy, (4) commitment, and (5) action.

Balance: Step 1: Perspectives

Balance coaching starts by observing that there is a limiting perspective, and then naming it and exploring the impact of holding it.

You can generate more perspective by simply asking coachees What is another way of looking at this that would work for you? You can also brainstorm metaphors or images that provide creative material for additional perspectives.

Geography

When we explore the conditions within a perspective with coachees, we are looking at the geography of that world. There is a native language in that perspective. There will be cultural rules and well-formed roles - certain things are permitted and encouraged; others are taboo or simply not possible.

Note that it is easier to work with perspectives when the topic is more specific, even if it is a relationship. The topic itself is neither positive nor negative. In fact, it must be neutral or there is an implied perspective.

Balance: Step 2: Choice

”Choice” at this step is also an affirmation of the power of choice itself. To be aware that there are real and distinct possibilities to choose from is liberating and empowering.

Balance: Step 3: Co-active strategy

A strategy in the co-active model includes the attitudes and emotional state that motivates and supports action.

No matter what form the creative process takes, the coach’s job is to encourage coachees to push the edge of possibilities, to travel beyond familiar alternatives. In this expansion mode, the intention is to redefine what “possible” means.

Given the rich and expanded world of possible actions, the next phase in the process is to narrow the list. This is the next choice point in balance coaching, and it presents an opportunity to make sure, again, that the course of action being considered will lead to more flow.

One of the things to watch for is a condition we playfully call “OOPS”: Overly optimistic planning syndrome.

Narrowing the action list is the step that moves us from coneration into reality. In coaching, it is not enough to have really good - even profound or wildly creative - talk about coachees’ issues, circumstances, and perspectives. It is essential that coaching be in action and that something is made real in the world that they can see and take note of.

Balance: Stage 4: Commitment

Before you invite coachees to take action, make sure they’ve really made a commitment to their plans.

Commitment implies there is no turning back. This is the point where you draw a line and ask the coachee to cross into new territory. Will you commit to that plan and take action? Will you do that?

Yes and No

As coachees prepare to commit to action, they must choose between saying yes to their plans and saying no to something else.

That yes to a simple action is a yes to some deeper commitment, a self-promise. Saying no to a simple action is much more than taking that one thing off the list. It often means saying no to old beliefs or expectations, no to self-betrayal, no to habitual ways of reacting to the demands of others.

Balance: Step 5: Action

Taking action without harvesting the learning is merely activity or busyness. Exploring the learning is what leads to individual development and meaningful results.

Grace and performance also demonstrate the balance point of leaning into what is possible while still maintaining control.

Balance coaching will help coachees choose the flow, a way to balance priorities, expectations, and perspective on the issues they bring to their coaching sessions.

Our goal is to help coachees create the ride of their life.

Process: Main

Our focus is on the coachee’s life experience, not just a list of action items completed. In fact, we believe coachees actually want to enjoy the journey, to savour and appreciate each moment of their lives as best they can.

Process coaching focuses on the internal experience, on what is happening in the moment.

The nomination of going somewhere and going more deeply into the experience is the full spectrum of life. Being present in life expands awareness, leads to richer highs and robust lows that are the measure of a true life fully lived.

Process: The coach and process

In process coaching, you are tuning your ear to hear below the surface, noticing anything stirring that feels out of place, inconsistent, something like resistance or an expected turbulence.

Process: Process coaching

Sometimes the way forward involves going down into the experience first.

The flow in process coaching has the following steps\
1 - The coach senses the turbulence under the surface and names it

2 - The coach explores it

3 - The coachee experiences it

4 - A shift happens

5 - Energy opens up

6 - The coachee has access to new resources

7 - Movement happens

Process: 1 - Sense the disturbance and name it

The energy of the emotion is a flashing sign - sometimes dimly flashing, sometimes brightly flashing.

When the coach hears it, here or she speaks or names it - and invites the coachee to look there, too.

When you point below the surface to the energy or emotion, you give the coachee an opportunity to learn more about what is obviously important.

Where fulfilment has vision and values to make meaningful choices, and balance has action and planning, process can feel like vast territory without a map or compass. Where balance relies on commitment, process relies on trust.

Process: 2 - The coach explores it

Once you have heard and named the turbulence, the next step is to explore the territory - but first you must ask the coachee for permission.

For managers it’s especially important to ask permission. It’s both responsible and respectful of the other person’s feelings in the moment.

One of the more effective access points for exploring the moment is the coachee’s immediate physical experience: breathing, tension, a furrowed brow, tightness in the throat, or a rapid heartbeat. The body is remarkably expressive, and it is a rich source of information about the coachee’s internal experience.

Process: 3 - The coachee experiences it

The key here is that the coachee actually experience the sensation or emotion. It is important for the coachee to be able to name it and identify it, even if only in a few words.

Process: 4 - A shift happens

The air, the tone, the light, the weight - it’s hard to find the right words for it, but it is a sensation of new movement. We are no longer driving; we are rising.

Process: 5 - Energy opens up

The shift is accompanied by a sense of opening, release, expansion.

Process coaching unblocks that stuck energy and allows the energy the emotion to serve the coachee. Unblocked energy creates motion.

Process: 6 - Coachee has new resources

Once the shift happens and coachees find they are in new, more expansive territory, they also have access to more of their own internal resources.

Process: 7 - Movement happens

The outcome of process coaching is a shift in the internal experience combined with new or renewed learning.

Coaching is about moving forward, and sometimes progress starts with going into the experience, not skipping over it.

Process: Going up into it

Coachees can be so driven to move on to the next stage or the next project or challenge that they want to skip the celebration of their accomplishments - and miss the chance to discover more about themselves and the keys to their success.

As a coach, part of your job is to listen for the kind of avoidance that keeps your coachees from experiencing the whole range of musical notes available to them.

Process: Feelings as information, not symptoms

Don’t be a detective about it. Don’t look at why the coachee is hurt or angry - which is the typical response. The cause itself is not important; accepting the feeling is important. Nor is it up to the coach to try to heal it or stop it.

The process can be very cleansing, and if we don’t permit our bodies to discharge and discover whatever we’re holding inside, we don’t grow.

Process coaching is where emotions will show up because you’re encouraging, even challenging, coachees to visit the hard places and go into experience so they can learn why this is important.

Exploring forbidden territory with humour can give coachees licence to approach the dark areas on light feet or to feel curiosity about the depth of the murky water instead of fearing that they are about to drown.

Process: Process and accountability

With process coaching, the action is designed to support what the coachee discovers from the coaching session.

Process: To be with

A word or two is in order about the expression “be with,” which is often used with process coaching. We might say, for example, that the coachees are “being with” disappointment, or the coach is “being with” coachees and their disappointment.

To be with is to be present and fully engaged, attentive, open, even interacting, but with no goal other than simply being together.

Coachees are uncomfortable - sometimes downright miserable - because their lives are taking them places where they do not want to go. Coachees in this situation want to chance course and avoid those areas. What they get, over time, are lives filled with avoiding.

We could also say that our job is to help coachees stop avoiding, pretending, denying. From this empowered place, they will be able to make better decisions and be stronger in their relationships and at home.

Process: Where do you stop?

If you are not conscious of your own off-limits areas, you’ll shortchange your coachees, because as soon as they start to go there, you’ll steer them away. Coaches, therefore, must do their own rigorous process of self-discovery - ideally with their own coach.

Putting it all together

We might think of the three principles as three different tools. When coach and coachee explore values, a future vision, or the self-sabotage that can keep coachees from achieving their vision, the coach is pulling from the fulfilment toolkit. When the coach helps coachees look at an issue from a variety of different viewpoints or consider plans or action options, the toolkit is balance-based. The coach who forms a container around the current moment and delves more deeply into it is in the general area of process.

The coaching direction comes from listening at levels 2 and 3.

It also doesn’t work for you, as coach, to have your attention on the tool set, thinking about which principle you are working in, which context of the model you are using, or what skill to pick from the glossary. This is awareness at level 1, and when you are at this level, you have disconnected from the coachee.

As coaches, we are always empowering our coachees.

In almost every case, we overestimate what we need to know. After all, coachees are the experts on their own lives and work situations; the coach is the expert in helping them find the next course of action and reap the learning from the action they take.

There is always something important underneath the situation presented, or it would not be worth the coachee’s or coach’s time. Part of the coach’s job is to look for whatever makes an issue important in the coachee’s life.

Wearing multiple hats

Coaching, however, does not focus on the emotional issues and the relationship web that results. Emotion may be present in the conversation but it is not the work of coaching.

The coach’s commitment

As coaches we need to be constantly vigilant, constantly holding a vision for our coachees that on some days they are not able to hold for themselves. Leaders and managers need to stay committed to the larger purpose in spire of the short-term pressures.

As coach, you are the model of courageous questioning. Part of your job is to be blunt - to say the unpopular, or even unreasonable, thing to help coachees reach their potential and live their fulfilling life, however they define it.

You need to be willing to ask the tough question or tell the hard truth, even if it means your coachees will not like what they hear.

“You tell me if I go too far”.

The expanding world of coaching - Coachee relationships

It is the three-way dynamic created between the coach, the coachee, and the organisation. In this case, the coach needs to design a three-way alliance. Issues of confidentiality must be defined and roles clarified. Does the organisation expect a report from the coach or the coachee? Who sets the goals and criteria for the coaching - coachee or organisation?

There is tremendous power in an organisation that is fueled by fully motivated employees, and many organisations are aware that unmotivated employees are a drain on momentum.

Workplace coaches

It is especially important for workplace coaches to be clear about the boundaries for the coaching relationship.

So many options

Design your offering so that it is fulfilling - so that it resonates with your values and provides balance in your own life. Make it a design that allows you to love and live in the moment. In other words, let your practice be what you preach.

Coaching skills for a different conversation

Ultimately, the power comes from creating a coaching culture.

Imagine a world

Imaging a world of compelling vision set loose to create and prosper, totally supported, totally encouraged, totally celebrated. This would be a transformative world indeed.
