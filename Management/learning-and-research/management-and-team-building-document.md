### <mark style="color:yellow;">Core skillset managers need</mark> <a href="#lsexgsl4dz0t" id="lsexgsl4dz0t"></a>

Communication, people management, planning & organisation

Recruiting for technical skill only promote expert novices with low awareness and poor leadership and management skills. They won‚Äôt be able to satisfy the requirements of line managers and won‚Äôt be equipped to meet long-term needs and challenges.

Sink or swim as a manager leads to expert novices who lack critical leadership skills. Managers influence and manage all of the staff and provide direct results to clients. They need to be trained in leadership development.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Top ten things managers feel their peers don‚Äôt do well</mark> <a href="#cjxmw01yaysn" id="cjxmw01yaysn"></a>

\-Clearly communicate\
\-Effectively plan\
\-Deal with conflict at work\
\-Make decisions\
\-Give effective feedback\
\-Delegate\
\-Listen and being accessible to reports\
\-Setting goals\
\-Coaching reports\
\-Demonstrating emotional intelligence

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Types of management</mark> <a href="#t12tih1k0fqn" id="t12tih1k0fqn"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Competing**</mark> - Might makes right. Do what I want. When quick decisions are needed. Important for welfare of staff or protecting against unfaithful actors.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Accommodating**</mark> - Allowing the wider team to influence decision-making. Build up credits for later. When competition would have a negative impact.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Avoiding**</mark> - Trivial issues. When satisfying your needs are impossible. Waiting - gathering information. When others can resolve the conflict.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Collaborating**</mark> - When the solution is too important to all parties. Objective is the learn. Merge insights and work through hard feelings.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Compromising**</mark> - When goals are moderately important. Not worth the effort of potential disruption. When two equal parties are equally committed to mutually exclusive goals. Temporary settlement. Expedient solution when other modes fail.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Delegation</mark> <a href="#owsiyu44ov1t" id="owsiyu44ov1t"></a>

Delegation is not abdication - Not pawning work off onto people.

You want to be replaced and train your successor.

Delegation: Offer complete jobs to willing and able workers. Inform others of the delegation. Let go and coach. Praise a job well done.

3 Golden rules of delegation:\
\-Be hands off\
\-Keep your eyes open and monitor\
\-Praise success, correct errors

Seven levels of delegation

1. Do what I do
2. Have a look and tell me what you think
3. Give me recommendations, I‚Äôll let you know the best way
4. Do it with my go ahead
5. Do it unless I say not to
6. Do it and let me know
7. Just do it

The why before the what brings less resistance.

Delegation is also to get the best out of people.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Delegation Framework</mark> <a href="#dotarav8kwbk" id="dotarav8kwbk"></a>

Delegating is entrusting a task to someone else that you‚Äôre accountable for.

\-Explain why the job is important. Show trust.\
\-Describe what results are needed. Leave out the how (if possible)\
\-Give them authority to do the job.\
\-Indicate when the job has to be done by.\
\-Give them feedback on their work\
\-Ask for their feedback to gain understanding.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">7 Ways to delegate work</mark> <a href="#yd2iur4atg5m" id="yd2iur4atg5m"></a>

\-Do what I say. Little delegation\
\-Look into this and give me options. I‚Äôll decide the action.\
\-Give me your recommendation and I‚Äôll let you know if you can start.\
\-Decide and let me know, but wait for my goahead.\
\-Decide and let me know what you‚Äôre doing unless I say not to.\
\-Do it and let me know what you did\
\-Do it yourself

### <mark style="color:yellow;">7 Levels of delegating work to a group</mark> <a href="#lleq42hekqca" id="lleq42hekqca"></a>

\-Manager decides and announces\
\-Manager decides and explains why\
\-Manager presents decision and invites questions\
\-Manager presents provisional decision and invites conversation\
\-Manager presentes problems and asks for suggestions, then decides\
\-Manager presents problems and the team decides\
\-Manager allows the team to identify problems and execute solution

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Engagement</mark> <a href="#id-7zslnsc1axt9" id="id-7zslnsc1axt9"></a>

Ensure the goal alignment at every level is well-communicated. Top managers set business objectives, missile managers create specific objectives for employees that support goals. Employees should be given the tools to succeed, autonomy of some kind, and accountability to meet goals.

Vital steps of engagement:\
\-Recognise the high performers\
\-People should understand how their job contributes to the business strategy\
\-Senior leadership continually updates and communications strategy\
\-Business goals are communicated company-wide

Satisfied employees: feel safe at work and are given good training. They are valued and compensated fairly. They need to achieve against a purpose and meaning; an objective. They need to work in a trusting team that supports one another. You need to learn and grow.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Skill / Will matrix</mark> <a href="#w0qym2xo9cxx" id="w0qym2xo9cxx"></a>

Low skill / Low will - Nervous beginner\
Low skill / High will - Guide beginner\
High skill / Low will - Excite, bored\
High skill / High will - Delegate, growing

Everyone should be performance managed.

What is your purpose?

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Millennials vs management</mark> <a href="#id-2d10v4akvjqc" id="id-2d10v4akvjqc"></a>

Managers don‚Äôt typically know what millennials want from work, how they want to be managed and they feel their managers are underperforming. Being respected and valued is the more important value, with career progression and being trusted to get on with things, and good communication. Managers fail to understand the gap between what millennials value and what they actually want.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Time Management</mark> <a href="#doy3jfvi2rsc" id="doy3jfvi2rsc"></a>

You can‚Äôt manage time - you can only spend it. Use the diamond principle - rock solid and clear objectives. Priorities will be clearer. When juggling lots of tasks - What will matter the most long term; Which impact will be the most valuable.

Starting point - diamond principle

Middle - negotiable

Endpoint - Most valuable impact

Diamond principle: ‚ÄúThe Diamond Principle, briefly, is that the people who actually do the work in question need to be consulted before the work is changed, or a new pro¬≠cess is implemented.‚Äù

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-Questions</mark> <a href="#hmmz2d3gws0i" id="hmmz2d3gws0i"></a>

\-Is what I‚Äôm doing strategic?\
\-What am I giving up to do this?\
\-Am I the best person to do this?\
\-Who can I develop to do this?\

\-Schedule a time to act later\
\-Delegate the task\
\-Learn to say no

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Effective time-usage</mark> <a href="#rsk7y418g1co" id="rsk7y418g1co"></a>

Being non-stop busy makes you neither important nor effective. Find time to be reflective.

Urgent, not important - Trivial ad-hoc interruptions. (Reject diplomatically) 10%\
Not urgent, not important - Irrelevant and unproductive comfort. (Resist and stop) 0%\
Urgent, important - Serious issues, troubleshooting, deadlines (Do it now) 20%\

Planning is merely our best guess. If any factors have been missed or mis-read, then predictions become unreliable. Strategies for change if planned to rigidly are likely overtaken by unpredictable events. A plan should set a direction for a specific goal and make a plan keeping in mind the unpredictability of the future. You must allow for flexibility and responsiveness for unforeseen or unknown changes.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Stories to use</mark> <a href="#ukt0ha7yxvrp" id="ukt0ha7yxvrp"></a>

When Brandi Chastain scored a devastating goal for the other team

last summer, team captain Carla Over beck walked right up to her and told her, "Brandi, we have 85 minutes to get that goal back. We need you focused and fully into the game. Let's play.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">What makes a great team?</mark> <a href="#c8o61tr5m9de" id="c8o61tr5m9de"></a>

A successful team boils down to two things: mutual respect among team members and a common vision

about where the team is going.

Number two, all team members have to be positive thinkers. A team just can't function with an excuse-

driven, "no-can-do" member on board

Number six, each member must trust the motives of the other members.

Two, the members need to be driven by the team's results, not by individual results.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Interpersonal Development Review</mark> <a href="#jdfjqe3utfhz" id="jdfjqe3utfhz"></a>

For those who want to learn about it, small group sessions to discuss is a great idea.

Discuss how it was used, what was useful, how you did, is there anything new you found?

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Imposing change</mark> <a href="#khk7one64mi0" id="khk7one64mi0"></a>

Radical change imposed causes resistance and creates a worried workforce. This is followed by cynicism and disillusionment.

Too low anxiety erases possibilities for change and creativity, while too much creates panic and defensive behaviour. Change requires a leader to create the right amount of urgency to bring change.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self-organisation</mark> <a href="#id-3ogxn3975nmk" id="id-3ogxn3975nmk"></a>

This only happens when people can network and interact with complete freedom. They need empowerment first. Self-organisation is intricate teamworking where webs of communication exist. Each person pursues their own objectives they have set for themselves. Change is embraced if it has been happening already and not imposed from the top down. The environment needs to have stable management and actual leadership. The environment needs to exist between too much stability and too much chaos.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Types of team communication</mark> <a href="#g2x5rv1widfq" id="g2x5rv1widfq"></a>

Legitimate formal - structured communication channels and processes like emails and meetings.\
Shadow informal - general talking and gossip in social groups

### <mark style="color:yellow;">High performing teams</mark> <a href="#d1lnolpcozwz" id="d1lnolpcozwz"></a>

High performing teams are highly focused on their goals and return superior results. They outperform expectations. The output is greater than the sum of their parts. Collaboration and innovation. Strong accountability and trust.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Company goals</mark> <a href="#id-8tn6u24rauv" id="id-8tn6u24rauv"></a>

To unify all development information on learning, performance, and career planning for the sake of talent overview. Workforce visibility and quality builds flexible labour models. In competitive industries, it‚Äôs crucial for companies to understand who their key talent is, who is at risk of leaving, and what strategies will work. Companies should develop and monitor their employees.

Companies work better and become more efficient when they work on implementing integrated talent management. This increases employee agility in deployment. More data on employees can lead employers to make better decisions.

People are often the most expensive thing for an organisation and also the least optimised. This can be down to inadequate talent management which fails to delivery workforce visibility.
