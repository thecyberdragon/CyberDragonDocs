### <mark style="color:yellow;">The 3 steps of assertiveness</mark> <a href="#qf9a1undw6d" id="qf9a1undw6d"></a>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Assertion or Aggression</mark> <a href="#hbhrwbfhdznr" id="hbhrwbfhdznr"></a>

Assertion is standing up for yourself without putting the other person down

Aggression is standing up for yourself but violating others rights

Aggression ignores and dismisses the needs and feelings of others.

It’s based on beliefs that their wants and needs are more important.

To be assertive is to communicate and influence and gain self-respect without diminishing others.

To be aggressive is to dismiss the needs, wants, opinions, feelings and beliefs of others.

The aim in aggression is to win, is necessary at the expense of others.

It is the aggressive person who has the problem, not you.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Parent**</mark> - Critical (negative) and nurturing (positive). Critical parenting is quick to criticise and slow to listen. Nurturing is caring for the needs of others.

Four states of acceptance / life positions:

<mark style="color:yellow;">I’m OK with me, you’re not OK with me</mark> - domination. Distrustful, superior and arrogant. It can result in aggressiveness.

<mark style="color:yellow;">I’m OK with me, you’re OK with me</mark> - communion. Healthy and optimistic, resulting in assertive behaviour. These people accept others, listen, are tolerant and want to understand others. This takes effort to get into and maintain, the other three are automatic.

## <mark style="color:red;">Effect of difficult Behaviour</mark> <a href="#ey4elyuusn3i" id="ey4elyuusn3i"></a>

***

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Effects</mark> <a href="#id-87kuobcjzoh5" id="id-87kuobcjzoh5"></a>

Difficult behaviour from others lowers our own self-esteem. They might hit tender areas or paralyse your ability to respond accordingly. You might be hurt, devalued, or frustrated. It’s common to be confused. Part of the problem might be that you feel powerless to face such people. You might feel like you’re being controlled and if you give in to this you render yourself powerless.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Thinking</mark> <a href="#vwegcn8gx6pu" id="vwegcn8gx6pu"></a>

What behaviour do I feel is most difficult? What strategy will I adopt to counter this next time it happens?

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Negative language</mark> <a href="#js0ne8pgfy45" id="js0ne8pgfy45"></a>

Negative characteristics: What cannot be done, tone of blame “can’t, won’t, unable”.

Positive characteristics: What can be done, alternative and choices, helpful, stress positive actions.

Eliminate common negative phrases. Avoid blame, accusations, implicating they’re stupid, demanding, sacrasm.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">What makes people difficult?</mark> <a href="#mhiy17ku1phy" id="mhiy17ku1phy"></a>

Usually working from the negative side of their personality, rather than a conscious desire. They’re often unaware of how they affect others. They don’t realise how harmful their actions are to their own career success.

Difficult people put a strain on you as a manager, and the team, as being difficult can be contagious. Difficult people can ripple through a team by influencing others - either by making them difficult or lowering morale.

It’s not difficult people - it’s difficult behaviour. Labelling someone as difficult makes you pre-judge their behaviour in a way you expect to be difficult. Labelling people makes it easier to perceive them as difficult and make quick judgements.

It might come from needing to control their lives. A difficult person can be trying to control the people around them. People react to them which allows the difficult person to manipulate, influence, and control them. They don’t care if the reactions are negative as they create reinforcement.

Someone behaving with stubbornness might actually by an expression of fear or anxiety by the difficult person.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Solutions</mark> <a href="#lfqwhwo3yy45" id="lfqwhwo3yy45"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Vote with your feet</mark> - walk out. No one can make you feel inferior without your permission\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Change your attitude</mark> - Listen and engage differently. Reduce and free yourself from reactions\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Change your behaviour</mark> - When you deal with them differently, they have to deal with you differently.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Building blocks of trust</mark> <a href="#q31r98yd6q" id="q31r98yd6q"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Benevolence</mark> - does the organisation have my best interests at heart?\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Competence</mark> - are they competent enough to care?\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Overcoming conflict</mark> - is the organisation able to resolve conflict and promote healing and forgiveness?

### <mark style="color:yellow;">The shadow</mark> <a href="#io1lkb6t9r90" id="io1lkb6t9r90"></a>

The shadow is the negative and unconscious depreciated human emotion. It’s primitive, selfish and angry. They are the negative aspects that we don’t allow expression of. It is our interior and guilt-ridden self.

People unconsciously project their insecurities, their shadow onto others to avoid confronting it within themselves. It is what groups do when dehumanising, demonising or otherising the “enemy”. It makes a scapegoat of someone.

We hide the shadow from ourselves and others and it works in the unconscious. The shadow grows in strength the more you deny the responsibility of confronting it. A way to not fall to the shadow is to accept it and absorb it and strive for balance instead of projecting it onto others. You must hold yourself accountable for your own shadow.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">The desire to win in difficult people</mark> <a href="#vorbqhgqjfz4" id="vorbqhgqjfz4"></a>

When someone’s in an ‘against’ group, if they’re allowed to dominate the conversation, they win. If they get boxed into a corner they get to play the victim and they win. The solution is instead to control the conversation and to listen.
