### <mark style="color:yellow;">Hygiene factors & motivators</mark> <a href="#id-73bw88747rt2" id="id-73bw88747rt2"></a>

Motivation is a journey of discovery. Different things motivate different people.

Motivate with positive psychology. 90% of happiness is internal, 10% is external. Positivity motivates us towards success. You need to create the right climate or conditions for motivation to be enabled.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Hygiene factors - factors that keep people being annoyed (Extrinsic)</mark> <a href="#id-1cxtiscn98on" id="id-1cxtiscn98on"></a>

\-Authority\
\-Pay\
\-Working conditions\
\-Relationships with colleagues\
\-Fringe benefits

These increasingly become regarded as rights to be expected rather than incentives.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Motivating factors - get people enthusiastic (Intrinsic)</mark> <a href="#a901ly9260as" id="a901ly9260as"></a>

\-Achievement\
\-Status\
\-Challenge\
\-Recognition\
\-Responsibility\
\-Advancement\
\-Promotion\
\-Growth

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Motivators</mark> <a href="#h1pu6gssktz8" id="h1pu6gssktz8"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Extrinsic motivators**</mark>** -** Carrots on sticks. If this then this. (Rewards narrow focus and reduce creativity)\
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Intrinsic motivators**</mark> - Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose - make a contribution

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Hierarchy of needs</mark> <a href="#r1ud2111tpbo" id="r1ud2111tpbo"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Physiological</mark> - Food water and home

<mark style="color:yellow;">Security/Safety</mark> - Personal security and job security. Efficient managers and employees who think for themselves

<mark style="color:yellow;">Love and belonging</mark> - Relationships. See the end result of work and have interesting work.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Esteem/Ego</mark> - Self worth, respected. Respect and recognition.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Self-actualisation</mark> - Desire to achieve. Challenge and skill development.

These needs are both satisfied and unsatisfied at the same time. Needs overlap. Once a need is fulfilled, it isn‚Äôt a motivator anymore. More money becomes less satisfying as you move up the hierarchy but it‚Äôs no less important. They become entitlements and can act as demotivators.

There are two needs: the animal needs for preservation and the higher level need for growth.

Criticism

The main issue with the hierarchy of needs is that it treats motivation as something in isolation to the community. Motivators can change based on the person‚Äôs involvement with and expectations with the wider community.

## <mark style="color:red;">Research on motivation</mark> <a href="#on13t4dehlmc" id="on13t4dehlmc"></a>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">ILM Research findings</mark> <a href="#id-2a1r1c41vrie" id="id-2a1r1c41vrie"></a>

The best way to motivate someone is for them to enjoy their job. Treatment by their employer is one of the biggest potential motivators including more praise and a sense of being valued.

Managers tend to feel they‚Äôre performing well and being effective while the team they manage might not.

Always do as much as possible of the five fundamentals:

\-Coaching\
\-Giving feedback\
\-Listening\
\-Rewarding and recognising success\
\-Performance management

Older vs younger staff

Under 30‚Äôs are more motivated by salary than people over 30, perhaps because they get less than the older staff and have less money in general. Under 30‚Äôs are unlikely to be financially comfortable.

Appraisals are less effective for women who are more generally focussed on the social aspect of work.

Men are more likely to get something out of it as they‚Äôre more career-focussed. Women are more intrinsically motivated than men are generally.

Four out of the five top found motivators are intrinsic values, the outlier being base salary and perks.

It‚Äôs highly motivating to have adequate pay and benefits, especially for men. Employees undervalue the importance staff put on money. People tend to say financial bonuses are a motivator but it actually tends not to be when questioned indirectly. Base salary being adequate is motivating while financial rewards aren‚Äôt. Pay Rises work to motivate (or prevent demotivation).

The general motivators in line with Frederick Hertzberg‚Äôs motivational theory are: Autonomy, frequency of interaction with other people, and a chance to innovate. The biggest factor is job enjoyment. Their relationship with their manager and how they feel they are treated and valued and the control they have over their work is also highly motivating.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Performance management</mark> <a href="#hr3ownjgo153" id="hr3ownjgo153"></a>

What is it:

\-Performance improvement\
\-Development\
\-Managing behaviour

How to do it:

\-Agree rules & responsibilities\
\-Agreed and achievable actions\
\-Create development plan\
\-Agree a review practice\
\-Appraisal should hold no surprise

Everyone should be performance managed.

What is your purpose?

Behaviour and impact are reciprocal.

You need time to work. Interruptions derail the work phase process.

Favoured work places

\-A place (garden, desk, coffee shop)\
\-Moving place (train, plane)\
\-Time (Early, late)
