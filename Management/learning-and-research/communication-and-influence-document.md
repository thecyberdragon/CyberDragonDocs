Something better to say - Putting energy into waiting for the person to finish or a pause to introduce our point

What comes next - Too much effort into questions we need to ask that we don‚Äôt listen to the answers

## <mark style="color:red;">Communicating</mark> <a href="#pfsot7jpz4cq" id="pfsot7jpz4cq"></a>

***

The best communication is when we hear something that hasn‚Äôt been said. It requires investment in the person and the moment. It takes respect and trust. What we respect we give time to. To not give people time, it says to them that they‚Äôre not important.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">The PIMMS model</mark> <a href="#so6gfux32d37" id="so6gfux32d37"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Purpose</mark> - why are you communicating\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Intent</mark> - what do you intend to do\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Meaning</mark> - what meaning do I want the other person to come out with\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Method</mark> - phone call, email, face to face, how will I deliver the communication\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Structure</mark> - what form should the communication take

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Giving clear communication</mark> <a href="#id-1628q2w3xg2k" id="id-1628q2w3xg2k"></a>

Limit assumptions and be concise.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Use the 3 F‚Äôs</mark> <a href="#id-54w6avc4wviw" id="id-54w6avc4wviw"></a>

I understand how you feel‚Ä¶\
I‚Äôve felt like that before‚Ä¶.\
Here‚Äôs how I found‚Ä¶.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Improving speech</mark> <a href="#srlvqoho9f45" id="srlvqoho9f45"></a>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Assertive communication</mark> <a href="#ijiva7pdw4hx" id="ijiva7pdw4hx"></a>

\-Eye contact - break it after asking questions. 2-4 seconds sustained is comfortable\

\-Don‚Äôt speak too fast or slow\
\-Avoid long gaps and using filler words\
\-Aim for confident and relaxed\
\-Be composed with upright body language\
\-Minimise exaggeration, nervousness, or aggressive hand movements

Think Fast Talk Smart

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Four stages of communication</mark>

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Approach</mark>

Approach communication openly as an opportunity to share ideas

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Audience</mark>

What do they need to hear? Be inservice of the audience.\
What is their knowledge? Can information be scaffolded?

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Expectations</mark>.

What is it they expect from me?\
Attitude. What do they think of this?\
Context. Time of day. Tone. Location.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Structure</mark>

Chronological. Past, present, future. Map / expectations.\
Problem, solution, benefit\
What, so what, and what‚Äôs next.

## <mark style="color:red;">Feedback</mark> <a href="#wmtt1q3oaw0d" id="wmtt1q3oaw0d"></a>

***

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Giving Feedback</mark>

Timing\
Concise and descriptive, not evaluative\
Not too much / fed to them in bite size chunks\
Achievable / actionable\
Make a suggestion

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Bad feedback</mark>

Focuses on blame which creates defensiveness and confrontation. Doesn‚Äôt improve skill. Undermines self-confidence. Person feels judged.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Good feedback</mark>

Focuses on improvements that are achievable and possible. It creates trust and cooperation. Improves skill. Increases confidence in ability and motivation. Clarifies position and what to do next. Person feels helped.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">In General</mark>

Focus on issues not people. Create positive goals. Example - Effect - Change\
Should be evidence-based performance.\
Why = blame. Makes people defensive.\
Be specific (behaviour, not person) - Timely (asap) - Concise - Be yourself - Be positive - Thank them

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Four Types of Feedback</mark> <a href="#acbdu462wwua" id="acbdu462wwua"></a>

Specific positive feedback.\
Specific developmental feedback.\
General positive feedback. Non-specific praise.\
General developmental feedback. Non-specific criticism.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Be understanding</mark> - show them you understand by repeating it back

<mark style="color:yellow;">Express opinion</mark> - explain your perspective.

Highlight common ground and build a resolution\
Help them improve to be the best they can be.\

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Scope model</mark> <a href="#prlt6c5a5bau" id="prlt6c5a5bau"></a>

S - Symptom. Show evidence\
C - Cause. What causes the problem?\
O - Options. What can they do to rectify?\
P - Preference. What‚Äôs the best option for both parties\
E - Execute action.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Delivering feedback</mark> <a href="#ron2ldfxhs65" id="ron2ldfxhs65"></a>

Praise - 20%\
Critique - 60%\
Praise - 20%

Use ‚Äúand‚Äù not ‚Äúbut‚Äù. Limit the feedback to a few important points so they‚Äôre not overwhelmed

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Three types of feedback</mark> <a href="#vcxv6tg8u8y" id="vcxv6tg8u8y"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Responsive</mark> - Instant feedback about what people say or do\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Objective</mark> - Feeding back objective data\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Subjective</mark> - Feeding back with opinion

## <mark style="color:red;">Influence</mark> <a href="#zebrviui3jj2" id="zebrviui3jj2"></a>

***

You can‚Äôt influence people when you judge them.\
If you look for blame, you can‚Äôt solve the problem

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Types of influence</mark> <a href="#id-27rfspa2im49" id="id-27rfspa2im49"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Reciprocity**</mark> - Scratch my back I‚Äôll scratch yours\
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Authority**</mark> - Coming from authority\
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Social proof**</mark> - Everyone else is doing it\

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Like**</mark> - Liking the person\
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Scarcity**</mark> - Deadlines, availability etc

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Effective influencing</mark> <a href="#v6l9mc6fr6yh" id="v6l9mc6fr6yh"></a>

Emphasise relevance with relevance. Visual inputs have higher power.\
Match words with deeds. Match abstract with examples.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Influence, Persuasion, Negotiation</mark> <a href="#ivizmey1f6xv" id="ivizmey1f6xv"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Influencing**</mark> - The power over others (unconscious). By what we are and what we do.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Persuasion**</mark> - Purposeful communication to change attitude or behaviour (Conscious). Integrity and openness of manager, ability to reason and use logic, and by gaining voluntary commitment. Ability to give compelling value to others based on their viewpoint, not mine. Seek to understand before being understood.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Negotiating**</mark> - Options are the key. The person with the fewest options ends up losing. Have other options.

Rejecting a proposal. Say no and wait. The next person to speak makes a concession.\
Never offer to split the difference. The person who makes the suggestions loses power.\
Show them you‚Äôre not happy. No poker face.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Two types of people</mark> <a href="#u64bk5mh08t2" id="u64bk5mh08t2"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Specific details**</mark> - Small details and specific information. Avoid generalisations. Provide information in logical sequences. Words like: next, then first, exactly.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Global big picture**</mark> - conceptual and abstract. Avoid any details and present the bigger picture at the start. Build up the picture in their mind. Details muddy the picture. Use pictures like framework, overview, result.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Strongest influence</mark> <a href="#id-35ttic4ayzar" id="id-35ttic4ayzar"></a>

\-Focussing to develop employees (receiving feedback about competencies)\
\-Retention (manager is effective at developing me and I have work life balance)\
\-Engagement

Mixing all three gives

Two strong influences on employees:\
\-Understanding the career path\
\-The ability to feedback to senior management about strategy and culture

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Influencing through speech</mark> <a href="#fvn6k8um91yw" id="fvn6k8um91yw"></a>

\-Three breathless sentences\
\-Three openings to sentences that start the same giving the illusion of emotion\
\-Balanced sentences give the impression of balanced thinking\
\-Metaphor influences perception\
\-Exaggeration gives sense of emotional distortion\
\-Rhyming makes sentences land better

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Illusion of control</mark> <a href="#qzjirqnrpi10" id="qzjirqnrpi10"></a>

Control is an illusion - what‚Äôs real is influence, and influence requires skill. To influence the world outside we first have to influence ourselves.

Creating habits will change your conditioning.

You‚Äôll never get there. It‚Äôs all about the process.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Persuasion</mark> <a href="#n1059mgstmen" id="n1059mgstmen"></a>

Honour and respect are the first principles of persuasion.\
Understand the other person‚Äôs frame of reference. The right words don‚Äôt mean the right messages.\
Three dimensions of communication: heart, mind, will\
Salt the horses oats and he‚Äôll want to drink

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Prepare to negotiate</mark> <a href="#l9w22wvotihn" id="l9w22wvotihn"></a>

\-Prepare (what do we want). Establish clear objectives and outcomes. Upper and lower limit.\
\-Discuss (what do they want).\
\-Propose (what can be done).\
\-Bargain (firm up proposal and set agreement).

## <mark style="color:red;">Stories</mark> <a href="#m8wl10nkbcro" id="m8wl10nkbcro"></a>

***

Stories help people bypass their own defences.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">The power of stories</mark> <a href="#kkch65vn9wa" id="kkch65vn9wa"></a>

\-It‚Äôs not what you say, it's how you say it.\
\-Stories motivate and inspire people.\
\-A great story can teach people new things\

\-Reach out to audience emotions (emotive language)

## <mark style="color:red;">Behaviour</mark> <a href="#kox73c318zjs" id="kox73c318zjs"></a>

***

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Body Language</mark> <a href="#ufpufqfbtk1" id="ufpufqfbtk1"></a>

Body language is to influence others and ourselves.\
The mind influences the body. The body influences the mind.\
Open up body language to encourage strength and power.\
Own your presence. Body language is also talking to you.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Behaviour‚Äôs root</mark> <a href="#ppnykr4rz595" id="ppnykr4rz595"></a>

\-Someone has filtered experiences through deleting, generalising, and distorting\
\-This has made a picture in their minds\
\-This affects their state of mind\
\-They show how they‚Äôve filtered information in their own way

Forcing a change in behaviour changes someone‚Äôs thinking.
