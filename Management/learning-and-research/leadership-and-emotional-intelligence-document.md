Leadership is empowering staff by influencing the way they influence themselves.\
Super-leadership - Lead others to lead themselves.\
Leadership exists at all levels.

> “Leadership is people work. If you don’t love ‘em you can’t lead ‘em.”

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Make people feel safe</mark> <a href="#vcct0irfko8y" id="vcct0irfko8y"></a>

Leadership promoted trust and cooperation.\
Trust and cooperation are feelings and need to develop.\
Put people before numbers, not numbers before people.\
When you sacrifice for the team, they sacrifice for you.\
The message is more important than the action.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Circle of safety</mark> <a href="#acdns7p7sweu" id="acdns7p7sweu"></a>

The group fighting off danger.\
If there is infighting or disharmony, then there’s no safety.

## <mark style="color:red;">Qualities needed of new leaders</mark> <a href="#tpiz579zbef7" id="tpiz579zbef7"></a>

***

Succession planning is essential for any business that wants to survive.

Courage, commitment, capacity and curiosity are all required to be a leader.

Leadership traits wanted in senior managers: Visionaries who are motivated and inspiring who are emotionally intelligent, trustworthy, have great leadership skills, who communicate well, who are driven and ambitious.

You need the ability to motivate, be emotionally intelligent, and be a natural leader. You need strengths in all areas not just once. You also need the technical skills, as well as commercial and financial skills to understand how the business works. They need skills in people management and development, communication, coaching and feedback and team management skills.

They need to show they can cope with pressure and failure. You need to be able to deal with difficulties and challenges. Leadership is about participation and engagement. You are expected to understand, inspire, and motivate people. You need the ability to deliver and implement projects. Senior leaders need to blend these characteristics, skills, knowledge and experience into a balanced all-round approach.

A sound grounding in management and leadership theory and strategic planning is a strong basis for academic study in management and business. An MBA is more useful after this.

Good leaders and managers are self-aware, and understand they can become better. They understand as the work changes, so must they.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Ability to lead</mark> <a href="#uhvrjf4rnclj" id="uhvrjf4rnclj"></a>

Capacity to lead is affected by their ability to lead in the organisation.\
Hierarchy and bureaucracy can undermine and devolve leadership.\
Short-term bottom line thinking can overshadow leadership priorities.\
Individualism undermines collaborative efforts.\
‘Us’ and ‘them’ cripple department collaboration.\
Training someone on leadership is not enough - the environment must give them the ability to lead.

## <mark style="color:red;">A Leader’s Role</mark> <a href="#qwxv6axed6em" id="qwxv6axed6em"></a>

***

### <mark style="color:yellow;">The changing nature of leadership</mark> <a href="#dwkhldg1ujdm" id="dwkhldg1ujdm"></a>

A leader’s job is to create space for other people to create new ideas where people come together and have meaningful conversations to be more effective, agile and prepared to respond to challenges. A leader achieves results through collaboration, teamwork and innovation. You have to do all three well. They need to be flexible and experience numerous diverse experiences. They experiment so when approaches are needed they don’t have to be built while in the middle of a challenge.

Organisations should create an environment that rewards team effort over individual achievement and promote a culture that allows people to work together. Culture dies when you don’t work on it.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Responsibility</mark> <a href="#czzve0j7s7oz" id="czzve0j7s7oz"></a>

Leaders take responsibility when it’s optional. They believe the organisation's success is their responsibility no matter their title. They don’t do it all themselves, but they make it possible for everyone else to succeed. They worry if they’ve done enough for their people. They hope they’ve provided the right tools for training. They want to create a culture that helps others achieve. They take responsibility for helping individuals succeed.

Pull leaders don’t just let space and culture happen, they shape their environment. There’s no better way to lead than let people lead in shaping the organisation. Let them design the environment and create the work world that best leads them to success.

A leader’s influence & purpose

Tell people that when they join, that they will leave a better version of themselves for having been here.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Leading women</mark> <a href="#id-7mm4jlamo527" id="id-7mm4jlamo527"></a>

Women tend to lack self-belief and confidence which leads to more caution and less risk-taking, and to follow a less straight-forward career path. When starting a career women have less clarity over direction than men and have lower expectations and ambition. Women are also less likely to want to become a manager. They set their sights lower than men do and are more likely to limit their ambition.

This lack of risk-taking and hesitation can lead to career setbacks in a competitive environment. Confidence is linked to achievement. Women with low confidence are less likely to achieve.

Open advertisements for internal positions might not produce the best results. Personalised development and support for selected employees can help women set more ambitious goals and stretch themselves

Praise in public, critique in private.\
Leverage your strength by pairing them with those of others.\
Maximise everyone’s traits and use them to their fullest. Team up people with complementary skillsets.

## <mark style="color:red;">Dealing with negativity</mark> <a href="#oz1tg717g612" id="oz1tg717g612"></a>

***

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Blame culture</mark> <a href="#vf81df4pb53h" id="vf81df4pb53h"></a>

\-Identify that blame culture exists - The manager is in control of the culture\
\-Take accountability - It’s good for the leader to take the brunt of the blame\
\-Change the culture - It exists because members are afraid of making mistakes

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Ethical fading</mark> <a href="#qbb6ca18y1g3" id="qbb6ca18y1g3"></a>

Collective dishonesty that we partly acknowledge but reason away. It’s the slipping of standards because of some reason or another. It’s fulfilling obligations without actually doing them.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Dealing with negativity</mark> <a href="#v1o02uhhh36t" id="v1o02uhhh36t"></a>

\-Calmly but firmly disagree\
\-Show examples why the person should be positive\
\-Ask for their ideas to the problems they’re facing

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Individualism hindering leadership</mark> <a href="#yxvbnddgkekb" id="yxvbnddgkekb"></a>

Faced with competing priorities, people will focus on roles directly linked to their performance. If specific targets don’t add up to the person they will likely pursue personal career goals and ignore team responsibilities.

When in survival mode in the face of blame culture and perverse incentives, the person will likely favour efforts that don’t bring penalties rather than long-term company objectives. If you’re pressured into doing things it can inhibit your ability to lead.

Managers can cut corners and put their needs ahead of the group when under pressure to perform tasks.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Negativity</mark>

Recognise it, stop it and replace it.\
Replace it with something constructive\
If you don’t control your pessimism, it’ll control you.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Spreading positivity</mark> <a href="#g0w74jsd6mke" id="g0w74jsd6mke"></a>

Managers who are happier believe they work to a high standard and create a positive work environment. Unhappy managers rate their performance lower. There is a strong correlation with state-of-mind and ability to copy with workload. It correlates with happiness and performance.

Managers who think their reports are happy do better all round, and don’t think so don’t. Happiness flows up and down in a team. Happiness and positivity makes you better at using resources and working with people. Training and development has a direct impact on managers' performance ratings. Better developed managers are more skilled and capable, and make happier and higher performing team members. Early development has the largest impact.

Happiness and successful management is the ability to handle and manage stress and workload. Optimism in the organisation is linked to self-performance. Managers need to be trained early on and trained on planning, organisational and time management, setting goals, delegation and motivation. Trained managers make staff happier and increase loyalty.

Too much stress makes people defensive and overworked, while no stress makes people complacent and unchallenged. People need challenges to be engaged with work but not too much that it affects performance and wellbeing.

To generate a vision, leaders need to be able to analyse the environment they work in. They need to forecast how it will develop and plan where they want it to go.

Positivity is driven by training and development from the bottom up, as well as increasing engagement and performance.

It’s very important to use positive language and avoid negative phrases and ones that are unhelpful.

It’s the words you say and how you say them that draw people to you.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Value-based leadership</mark> <a href="#pzvnkycgyokl" id="pzvnkycgyokl"></a>

Values need to be linked to performance and rewarded by behaviour that embodies those values. They need to be explicitly communicated why the values are important. Director’s expect company values to match their own but most employees don’t agree with that. This leads to low engagement. The further you are from setting values, the less likely you will be connected by them.

Values should not be formulated in isolation but built as part of the organisations overall strategy. Values should be the behaviour of the organisation and they need to help them achieve their goals.

There should be an honest culture where ethical issues and behaviour can be discussed. This leads to an organisation where values truly matter.

The alignment of organisation values and practice is the development and training of leadership.Value-based leadership leads to inclusive leadership. You need to act as you want others to.

Real values are displayed through actions not works. Who is rewarded, promoted and let go. Employees who display the core values should be celebrated with reward. When values are breached the organisation should share the blame and discuss why it happened.

Most managers don’t have the language or familiarity with ethics to talk about values fluently. Honesty about values is very important. How values are reached is also vital to communicate.

Through trust, create a safe environment where staff are supported to do their best work.

Create a climate that encourages and values contribution from each member.

Daily work makes people lose sight of the goal. Remind them often. Introduce updates to keep them informed and engaged. Tell the truth, frame the relationship as mutual support, set direction, and align team strengths. Build culture and working relationships.

As jobs become enriched the need for supervision disappears, and unsatisfying supervision roles can be enriched by enlarging responsibility to include more leadership and management.

## <mark style="color:red;">Leading through change</mark> <a href="#luabcwk7tqlb" id="luabcwk7tqlb"></a>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Inspirational leadership</mark> <a href="#id-2mtma7khtdr" id="id-2mtma7khtdr"></a>

What you do - Information\
How you do it - Process\
Why you do it - Purpose

Inspiration comes from communicating purpose, process, information.

> “People don’t buy what you do, people buy why you do it”

What we do proves what we believe.

Level 1 - Feelings, behaviour, trust, decisions\
Level 2 - Rationalism, language, analytical

Why to what inspires commitment\
What to how wants money

16% - Laggers

## <mark style="color:red;">Leadership styles</mark> <a href="#x48n6bcmyuq1" id="x48n6bcmyuq1"></a>

***

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Autocratic**</mark> - Creates a clear structure and makes clear to members what expectations are. Delegated work to members makes them responsible. Uses management by exception. Praise and reward exceeding expectations, and correcting low performance.

Managers make loads of decisions and have the authority of decision making. Seek to retain responsibility rather than fully delegate. The manager makes the decision. They work on the task at hand instead of developing their own leadership skills.

Old-fashioned style that works in the short-term but not long-term. Reduces team stress and improved speed. Works for poorly motivated employees. However, it robs team members of opportunity and long-term productivity. Larger workload on the manager and has long-term effects on morale and team members lose their initiative and confidence to make their own decisions.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Democratic**</mark> - Promotes sharing of responsibility and delegates a lot. Seeks consultation and gives full control and responsibility. Welcomes feedback and encourages others to become leaders and develops the team as leaders.

Encourages creativity and ideas. Progression and development focussed. Brings out the best in others and creates a positive working environment. Better communication with team members - about inclusion. More initiatives taken and better decision-making. More feedback. People share ideas. More loyalty to the leader.

Autocratic leadership in disguise pretends to be democratic for lip service, but doesn’t follow up.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Bureaucratic style**</mark> - Make sure members follow procedure. Works in dangerous places that need rule-following. Public sector work. Works in formal environments and when management comes with authority. When managers demand status and team members are rewarded for rule-following.

When rule-following and health and safety cannot be compromised. Leads to lack of motivation, office politics, authoritarian policies. Dehumanises business and removes enjoyment. Team members are puppet-like and doesn’t encourage growth.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Charismatic style**</mark> - Follow inspiring people. Creates and develops a vision. Communicates the importance of vision and builds integrity and trust.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Practical Leadership</mark> <a href="#id-3sblzyoq0uwf" id="id-3sblzyoq0uwf"></a>

Group influence - bringing about a willing effort on the part of the group towards a goal

Command - ability to make up one’s mind quickly as the situation demands with firmness and strength of purpose

Coolness - remaining cool and unperturbed under testing or trying conditions

Judgement - ability to arrange resources and information systematically in a sensible way

Responsibility - dependability and sustained effort to complete or achieve

### Transactional or transformational leadership <a href="#o8l89biayazt" id="o8l89biayazt"></a>

Transactional leadership is one task for another, and exchange or transaction.

Transformational leadership engages a deeper relationship and looks for motivation and potential in people.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">How leaders can be more effective</mark> <a href="#uazevvyg1r1" id="uazevvyg1r1"></a>

Most leaders aren’t prepared to create optimal workplace environments where employees deliver their best.

Staff need to understand their goals and are held accountable for them. They need to receive developmental and strength feedback and be given opportunities to grow.

Critical skills that aren’t worked on are: fostering employee creativity and innovation, and leading across cultures.

Leaders need their organisation to hold them accountable for their interpersonal skills and results.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Leadership skillset</mark> <a href="#id-1754b0hrddqn" id="id-1754b0hrddqn"></a>

\-Building consensus and commitment\
\-Coaching and developing others\
\-Communicating and interacting with others\
\-Developing strong networks and partnerships\
\-Fostering employee creativity and innovation\
\-Identifying and developing future talent\
\-Inspiring others towards a challenging future vision\
\-Integrating oneself into intercultural environments\
\-Intercultural business communication\
\-Leading across countries and cultures\
\-Leading across generations\
\-Managing and successfully introducing change

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Leadership development</mark> <a href="#xarz8fcxeo0m" id="xarz8fcxeo0m"></a>

Development doesn’t matter unless they are followed up on and put into practice.

Strong leaders are made not just from leadership development, but strong selection and succession planning.

The most important leadership skills are ones that help them accomplish strategic objectives.

Failing to develop leaders’ skills such as coaching and developing others when the learning will stick is costly omission.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">VUCA</mark> <a href="#id-43p2x2bfql09" id="id-43p2x2bfql09"></a>

Vuca is dealing with volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. It is anticipating and reacting to the speed and nature of change, activating decisively without always having clear direction, navigating through complexity and chaos, and maintaining effectiveness through surprise and unpredictability. Most managers aren’t confident they perform well in VUCA. Organisations whose leaders perform well in VUCA make more money and perform better.

The four skills to practice to build up the preparedness in facing the VUCA challenges:\
\-Managing and introducing change\
\-Building consensus and commitment\
\-Inspiring others towards challenging a future vision\
\-Leading across generations

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Effective leadership</mark> <a href="#ur6ocqm7ikha" id="ur6ocqm7ikha"></a>

\-Interacting is more effective than managing. The ability to leverage conversation is relationship capital.

\-Leaders without good time balance are a high cost to an organisation

\-Higher emphasis on management leads to high turnover, low engagement among leaders and less satisfaction

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Defining and modelling excellence</mark> <a href="#e527x5du1ort" id="e527x5du1ort"></a>

Questions:

\-What does excellence look like\
\-What communication is taking place\
\-What time issues do people deal with\
\-How are people learning from experience\
\-What does it look like when expectations are exceeded\
\-How are they showing creativity\
\-What happens when problems occur

### <mark style="color:yellow;">10 Commandments of improvement</mark> <a href="#efnj55m2inpc" id="efnj55m2inpc"></a>

\-Abandon fixed ideas\
\-Think of ways to make it possible\
\-No excuses\
\-Go for the simple solution, not the perfect one\
\-Correct mistakes right away\
\-Use ideas, don’t hide them\
\-Problems are opportunities\
\-Repeat ‘why’\
\-Seek ideas from others\
\-There is no end to improvement

Show up as a student. Being wrong is no longer a threat when you’re a student of learning - it’s a part of the experience.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Decision is destiny</mark> <a href="#o5628uaypaug" id="o5628uaypaug"></a>

What is our focus?

What does it mean?

What do we do?

2 mental patterns:

In the moment - current state. Physical and emotional state.\
Long-term - Our model for the world.

Motive -> Meaning -> Fuel

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Steps to great leadership</mark> <a href="#id-7cxbjjsgra2g" id="id-7cxbjjsgra2g"></a>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Where is the next change?**</mark>

Prepare for the next thing. Accumulate information.

Action a plan now. Great leaders aren’t head down, they see around corners.

They shape their future, not reacting to it.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**What is the diversity of the network?**</mark>

Develop relationships with diverse people who think differently to you.

**Do you have the courage to abandon the past?**

Dare to be different and take risks. Adapt to the future instead of doing what’s comfortable.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">High quality leadership makeup</mark> <a href="#ieor56d3n995" id="ieor56d3n995"></a>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Organisational efforts for quality leadership</mark> <a href="#t60otzwk2v3p" id="t60otzwk2v3p"></a>

\-Have a systematic process to determine required leadership skills\
\-Leader’s development plans are regularly reviewed\
\-There are formal programs to ensure smooth leadership transition\
\-Create highly effective development plans

The absence of the following negatively affects organisations:\
\-Feedback on key skills given to leaders\
\-Leadership competencies are clearly defined\
\-Leadership competencies server as the foundation for talent management\
\-Leaders’ performance expectations are linked with organisation strategy

It pays to fill positions internally and grow leaders.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Future planning leadership</mark> <a href="#gm7roucfu67m" id="gm7roucfu67m"></a>

The best planners look to the past from previously learned lessons.

Leadership development grows current as well as future leaders and creates managers who are more engaged and loyal.

Organisations that have great leadership, engagement and retention were most successful.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Challenges of human capital</mark> <a href="#saz45qoija45" id="saz45qoija45"></a>

\-Improving leadership development programs\
\-Making senior leadership more effective\
\-Improve the effectiveness of lower level leaders\
\-Improving succession planning

Companies can’t retain highly engaged and high performing staff without effective leaders to coach, develop, and inspire teams.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Organisational Values Research</mark> <a href="#oh1a5jzbzwm3" id="oh1a5jzbzwm3"></a>

79% would consider a company’s mission and purpose before joining. More than half said that company culture is more important than salary when it comes to job satisfaction.

Values are the bedrock. The culture sits on top of that. Culture shifts on top of values. It moves and evolves. Culture is a manifestation of values. Generations need to be catered to in their own way.

Values guide business decisions towards what’s right and important. The culture is the process and interactions that make up the environment. Values are principles - the rules you play by.

The days of top down directive management are gone. Workplaces are focussing on being great places to work. Employees can be advocates for their values by engaging with friends on their social media.

Things people look for:\
\-Company culture\
\-Absence of burnout\
\-Opportunities for growth

They want to know the organisation is making a difference.

People need to feel safe psychologically. Charity from leadership goes a long way. When people believe they are safe and secure, they’re able to embrace change easier.

Three points of authenticity\
\-Being genuine\
\-Having empathy\
\-Unconditional positive regard (acceptance)

Only 8% of companies have a structural health and wellbeing strategy to support work stress. When organisations embrace well-being into culture, everyone benefits.

Management should feel empowered and be inclusive to the employees. When people are under too much pressure they feel anxious and depressed which lowers output and performance. When employees are struggling or suffering, this attitude negatively affects the overall environment and the team. Managers highly influence culture. If managers aren’t engaged, it cascades to the team. Managers should discuss and promote wellbeing.

Values inflict pain. They limit freedom and constrain behaviour. They demand constant vigilance but the benefits are huge.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Purpose</mark> - Why the company exists. It should be true for the company and the people\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Vision</mark> - The difference the company will make in the world once purpose is realised\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Mission</mark> - Ambitious but achievable position that recognises purpose\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Values</mark> - The principles that accelerate progress together

Values must be aligned, understood and respected across departments and teams. This will have people following the same rules, establish similar behaviour and develop mutual respect and tolerance. When implementing values, all people should be implementing them all the time. When leadership aren’t observing and living those values, it creates dissent and resentment.

When leadership lives the values, there is more cohesion and sense that the values are alive. Standardised and centralised structure using company values helps offset silos. Silos are when departments or sectors don’t share information. They reduce efficiency and reduce morale. Values are only as powerful as the people who exhibit them every day.

Key steps to organising a business\
\-Defining company goals and plans

\-Keeping members motivated

\-Setting daily ,weekly, monthly or yearly goals\
\-Organising and decluttering office space\
\-Being punctual\
\-Clear and regular communication\
\-Have the right tools and systems in place

Inclusion in value creation goes a long way to create unified vision. It allows for community where everyone is clear on the common vision and goals. Silos are prevented this way and is vital for people in leadership to lead by example.

People must be given the space to question decisions that aren’t aligning with the values. People look to their own values when creating value systems.

\-People choose values over money\
\-Consultative processes are powerful\
\-Movement away from hierarchy\
\-Leadership must invest in values

When a company has values, it attracts people with strong core values and results in a mutual benefit.

When people are involved in creating values, the process is organic and authentic.

In less hierarchical structures, people are more likely to adopt and live core values. Emotions, goals and ambition can be easily shared and result in empathy and trust.

Leaders need to be seen as vulnerable and human.

Values inform culture, strategy, and success metrics. Values dictate behaviour and shape how people interact. They’re also a tool to create a common language for better understanding between people.

People live their values making culture adaptable. It changes whenever someone new joins.

Values can be revisited annually to update and make them more relevant. Value committees from across the organisation can help monitor the presence of values across the company. Values aren’t prescriptive or aspirational. Values celebrate what’s good with the organisation now what it should be. Values are about doing things.

Values from other companies\
\-Pursue happiness\
\-Foster empowerment and ownership\
\-Bring data, take action\
\-Learn, adapt and grow\
\-Hour achievement and show humility\
\-Earn trust every day\
\-Visible\
\-Engaging\
\-Respectful\
\-Inclusive\
\-Trusted\
\-Accountable\
\-Supportive\
\-Positively empowering\
\-Flexibly creative\
\-Actively inclusive\
\-Persistently supportive\
\-Proactively empathetic\
\-Clearly comunicative

Instilling values is intentional. Company values don’t infringe on personal beliefs. Positive values enhance creativity and talent and invite collaboration. They celebrate individual and collaborative success.

Deviation from values should be challenged. A balance must be struck between relentless challenging without being draconian. Base values on kindness.

Upside down leadership is turning the pyramid upside down, where leadership take ownership is ossies and support bottom up.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">How to act when you’ve been mistreated</mark> <a href="#utuoxhe57wbn" id="utuoxhe57wbn"></a>

Am I harbouring the spirit of revenge and self-righteousness? You have to be on guard.

Am I harbouring this? If so, you need to stop and not do what you’re going to do. Take a pause and think.

If you have been victimised, you otherise the other person.

Us against them givens the illusion of separation, but in reality, we’re all in this together.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Vulnerability</mark> <a href="#igkxd3kddejs" id="igkxd3kddejs"></a>

It requires boundaries and knowing why you’re sharing. Pretending otherwise is dangerous.

This can be called controlled flight into terrain - steadily flying into a mountain.

Vulnerability without boundaries is broadcasting pain for validation. The human connection is missing.

Complain, moan, get stressed and play the victim. Their influence shrinks

Suffer high levels of stress - fast-paced work

Overachievers. Reaching too many goals and strong achievements. Easily angered and short attention spans.

Good with stress - slow steady work

Relaxed and unhurried. Patient and non competitive. A desire to understand and listen.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Type AB**</mark>

Know when to relax, but take on challenge and competes

Comfortable to be around and likely the best of both worlds.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Self Control</mark> <a href="#vth1tg6faot4" id="vth1tg6faot4"></a>

Energy, mindset, environment

If you’re unaware of your behaviour, your environment controls you

Emotion is created by motion

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Neuro Linguistic Programming</mark> <a href="#id-64hkcqodfrz" id="id-64hkcqodfrz"></a>

This is a model about how we communicate to ourselves and others.

External event > runs through our internal processing > we make an internal representation of the event > that representation creates a state. A state is a state of mind - happy, sad, excited.

The internal representation includes images, sounds, dialogue and feelings. The state creates out physiology and influences behaviour.

Our five filters are:\
<mark style="color:yellow;">Meta programs</mark> - The way we handle information.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Belief systems</mark> - These are generalisations about how the world is. They create or deny personal power to us.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Values</mark> - Our attractions or repulsions we either move to or away from.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Decisions</mark> - Our collective memory of our past decisions. They can create belief or affect perception.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Memories</mark> - Our memories of past experience.

We experience our experience of the territory, not the territory itself.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Stress</mark> <a href="#id-8cbrl7v1wm8g" id="id-8cbrl7v1wm8g"></a>

Fight of flight mode - adrenaline and cortisol

\-Heart rate increases\
\-Temperature increases\
\-Rush of blood to the head\
\-Body gets pumped

Butterflies are blood diverting to the body to deal with stress.\
Healthy stress comes in bursts.\
Unhealthy stress is prolonged.

\-Practising unmastered skills

Preserving confidence when something goes wrong

Keep it temporal - it happened in the past. It doesn’t mean it will happen again\
Keep it specific - don’t generalise it. It was this specific issue\
Keep it external - don’t link it to who you are as a person

Take the pressure off the team and externalise it

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Big boat, little boat</mark> <a href="#qjczwiqjd6id" id="qjczwiqjd6id"></a>

Big boat - when it’s time to step up and be a high-performing leader

Little boat - sitting in a little boat with a little guy and communicating on their level as an equal

“If the hero doesn’t die in the book, the author hasn’t finished the story.”

Be a collector of bad wines - drink the rest.

To maximise your time yield, do everything in 3-fers. Do something you like, with a friend, in a good place.

It’s not the gift that’s important but the knowledge of the thought and effort that went into it.

“We’re divided by issues not united by purpose”

“Don’t be a spectator to your own success, be an active participant”

“Behind every problem is an opportunity”

“I will never be fixed, I will only get better, in so doing I will serve as an example for others, too. And that’s what makes a leader. Which is: I choose to do the work that I expect of you.”

“Choose your future, don’t react to one you don’t like.”

“Grass is greener where you water it”

“Don’t leave until you’ve left”

“If you revolutionise the way you think, you will change the way you behave and results will inevitably follow”

“How you hope is how you live.“

“What you resist persists. What you nourish will flourish.”

The leaders set the tone. Heroes are molded by their environment.

“Those who plan to be successful usually are, and those who fail to plan usually fail”

Patch up the wounds of broken hearts

We can’t live together if we don’t learn each others language

Don’t drop the mic

Great orators learn their material and learn their audience, to speak to the audience

Add language to heart

You are most powerful where you are most passionate

The value in life is depth

Don’t put a period where there should be a comma

What’s wrong is always available but so is what’s right. You get what you look for

Call an ambulance not the police

Poverty demands adornment. To decorate and make palatable. It’s the seasoning on the food. You provide the seasoning with the food, not the food with the seasoning. It's a presentation and an experience. It’s poetry and beauty.

You can’t move people if you’re not moved

Mix intellect with instinct. Instinct happens in the moment.

Diversity invites me to the party, inclusion is asking me to dance.

Discomfort serves you.

You don’t think your way to a new way of acting, you act your way to a new way of thinking.

Each miss gets you closer to the target as you know what doesn’t work.

The culture is how you action your values.

Kindness is the ability to be kind, but also the ability to interpret other things as kindness

Success is on the other side of struggle. You just have to push through it.

You never lose if you don’t quit

Good ideas rarely interrupt you, you have to look for them

Appreciation makes suffering disappear. You can’t be angry when you’re grateful

In the midst of pain we need to find beauty or there’s no momentum to find something new

The key to impact is putting purpose before process.

Every story matters because everyone values their story.

What might have been is the most devastating thing for impact.

In every interaction we can either win or lose the culture
